Notes on Documenting Equipment Use and Project Relevance
(EIC Pathfinder Context)
The following points are general suggestions on how to demonstrate that the purchase and use
of high-value equipment (in this case, NVIDIA DGX B200) are linked to the project. Some
measures apply mainly during project implementation, but they are also useful to consider at
proposal stage to ensure clarity and traceability. All approaches are, of course, subject to the ap-
plicable internal, departmental, or faculty rules governing equipment purchase and use.
1. Demonstrating that the purchase is project-related
To show that the equipment is required for the project, it may be helpful to:
• Reference the project in internal procurement documents (purchase requests, justifica-
tions, or orders mentioning the project acronym, number, and funding source);
• Include a project reference in the purchase contract or invoice, or attach an internal note
signed by the PI confirming the equipment is required for the project;
• Link the technical justification in the proposal to the specific tasks or work packages that
depend on the equipment;
• Keep an internal memo or approval note explaining the need for the equipment in relation
to project objectives, ideally dated before or at the time of purchase.
The aim is to maintain a clear and transparent paper trail showing that the purchase is neces-
sary and directly connected to the EU-funded activities. At proposal stage, this mainly involves
linking the technical justification to the expected research use.
2. Documenting the period and extent of use
If the equipment will not be used exclusively for the project, it should be possible to verify the ac-
tual share of use. Potential approaches (mostly relevant during implementation) include:
• Usage or access logs (system or job-submission tracking);
• Laboratory or computational logbooks (manual or digital, noting usage periods and pro-
ject identifiers);
• Scheduling or booking records (for shared infrastructure);
• Internal declarations by the PI or IT manager estimating usage share per project;
• Annual summaries aligning with project reporting periods.
The objective is to provide traceability and plausibility, ensuring that the declared share of use
aligns with the project’s technical activities and timeframe. While most of these measures apply
once the project is ongoing, it is advisable to briefly indicate in the proposal how equipment use
will be monitored and justified.
