Given that Pathfinder templates and evaluation procedures foresee one Principal Investigator (PI) per beneficiary, this configuration may create ambiguity regarding scientific and administrative responsibility. It is advisable to designate one formal PI and describe the second lead as a key team member or co-coordinator with defined responsibilites to ensure clarify and alignment with Program conventions.  \r\rNote on PI:  The designated Principal Investigator (PI) should have the institutional position and autonomy required to lead and execute the project effectively. This includes the ability to take scientific responsibility for the work, manage the allocated resources, and ensure project delivery with full institutional backing. If the proposed coordinators do not have this level of independence or authority, it may be advisable to consider assigning the formal PI role to someone with the appropriate standing. (The Evaluation Panel primary concern is the succesful execution and delivery of the project. Thus they will asssess wether the PI has the capacity, credibility and institutional backing to ensure the objectives/collaborations can be realistically achieved)\r\rMoreover, collaboration with external partners is mentioned, but their role and involvement require clarification. It should be specified in which capacity these partners will participate (as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners,etc.  - See Annex 2, PAge 142 of EIC Work Program-). Clearly defining this not only ensures transparency regarding responsibilities, data access, and task ownership, but also enables evaluators to assess the adequacy of the single entity to execute the proposed project."
