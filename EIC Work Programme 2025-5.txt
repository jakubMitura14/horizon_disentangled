I. Introduction
Strategic goals and Key Performance Indicators
The EIC was established to identify, develop and scale up breakthrough technologies
and companies, which are critical for EU policies to achieve the green and digital
transition and help ensure future open strategic autonomy in critical technologies.
The EIC Board provides strategic advice for the EIC Work Programme 1. For the period
2021-27 the EIC Board has recommended six strategic goals, with associated Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs), providing clear direction , track progress, and guide
implementation and potential new actions. 2 The baselines and progress against KPI
targets will be included in the annual EIC impact reports.  The KPIs represent mid to
long term targets.
Six Strategic Goals for the EIC:
1. To be the investor of choice for those with visionary ideas: The EIC must have
continent-wide recognition and traction with high potential start-ups,
entrepreneurs and innovative resear chers, in particular from under represented
groups such as women innovators and those from less developed ecosystems.
2. To crowd in EUR 30 -50 billion investment into European deep tech 3: The EIC
must bridge a critical financing gap faced by deep tech companies and leverage
the EIC Fund to influence the allocation of private assets in their support.
3. To pull through high -risk technologies in critical areas for society and open
strategic autonomy: The EIC must take risks and support the most promising
deep tech opportunities from the earliest stage to commercial scale -up,
delivering re levant innovations for society and safeguarding against
dependencies for key technologies.
4. To increase the number of European unicorns and scale ups: The EIC must
support the growth and scaling up of European start -ups and SMEs to match
and ultimately surpass the performance of the USA and Asia.
5. To catalyse innovation impacts from European public research and innovation :
The EIC must build partnerships to draw on, and commercialise, the best ideas
from the research base across the EU, and scale-up start-ups funded under other
EU or national initiatives.

6. To achieve operational excellence: The agility and speed  of EIC operations and
decision making must align with the expectations of applicants, investors and
market norms.
In addition, the EIC Board has published a set of recommendations to improve the
participation of innovators from widening countries in the EIC.4 The recommendations
are taken forward in the implementation of the EIC Work Programme, for example in
the outreach activities and selection of EIC experts and jury members.
Overview of the 2025 Work Programme
The funding and support available in 2025 is organised into four main funding
schemes:
1. the EIC Pathfinder for advanced research to develop the scientific basis to
underpin breakthrough technologies (Section II);
2. the EIC Transition to validate technologies and develop business plans for
specific applications (Section III);
3. the EIC Accelerator to support companies (SMEs, start -ups, spin -offs and in
some cases small mid-caps) to bring their innovations to market and scale them
up (Section IV); and
4. the EIC Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) Scale Up as this stems
from the EU regulation establishing the Strategic Technologies for Europe
Platform (STEP) 5 and Horizon Europe regulation 6, which provides additional
support to promising companies  driving innovation in critical areas 7 (SMEs,
start-ups, spin -offs and small mid -caps) to help them secure larger funding
rounds for further scaling their businesses (Section V).
In each case, the direct financial support to innovators is complemented with access to
a range of Business Acceleration Services (Section VI) providing access to leading
expertise, corporates, investors and ecosystem actors.
Pathfinder, Transition and Accelerator provide for “Open” funding which can support
technologies and innovations in any field without any predefined priority areas. In the
case of the Pathfinder and Accelerator, this Open funding is complemented by a set of
“Challenges” which target specific te chnologies and innovations of strategic interest
for the Union, including to support initiatives such as Net Zero Industry 8, Critical Raw

Materials9, the Chips Act10, and Health Emergency Responses11. The EIC STEP Scale Up
call targets technologies and innovations within the fields of digital technologies, clean
and resource efficient technologies , including net -zero technologies; and
biotechnologies. Outside of the calls, a budget is also set aside to support follow on
investments to companies selected under previous EIC Work Programmes.
In 2025 , support for start-ups in semiconductor technologies and quantum
technologies will be pursued in particular through the STEP Scale Up call which foresees
larger investments targeting strategic technologies including in support of the Chips
Act. The EIC Accelerator Open call remains available in general for  startups and SMEs
including for quantum and semiconductor technologies.
The Work Programme also supports a number of  innovation prizes (Section VII), and
additional supporting actions allow ing the functioning of the EIC such as expert
contracts, data management, communication and IT (Section VIII).
Linkages between these funding schemes will be maximised through proactive
management (see below) and new approaches, such as additional ‘Booster’ grants to
EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition projects (Annex 5), the Fast Track scheme to
accelerate the access of successful projects from EU programmes to the EIC Accelerator
(Annex 3) and the Plug in for access of projects stemming from national programmes
(Annex 4).
In complement to the EIC Work Programme it is envisaged that the Horizon Europe
Work Programme 2025 part on  Widening participation and strengthening the
European Research Area  (WIDERA), will introduce a pilot EIC Pre-Accelerator call to
support early -stage deep tech startups to develop  the technology, business and
investment readiness to levels that would enable them to successfully apply and attract
funding from EIC Accelerator or other sources. In anticipation of this call, the EIC Work
Programme foresees the eligibility of beneficiaries under the Pre -Accelerator call for
certain Business Acceleration Services and the Fast Track to the EIC Accelerator.

Main changes of the 2025 Work Programme
The 2025 Work Programme incorporates adjustments, improvements and
simplifications compared to the 2024 Work Programme, following the
recommendations of the EIC Board, the budget available and lessons learned during
implementation.
A major development is the introduction of a EIC STEP Scaleup call to provide larger
investments in companies  to develop certain technologies (see Section V) . This is
introduced as a pilot call and has a number of novelties as described in the call text,
including a shortened evaluation process and a link to complementary support from
Venture Debt from InvestEU implementing partners.
Other specific changes include:
EIC Pathfinder:
 Additional emphasis on the potential solutions to be provided in applicants
proposals for technology visions.
EIC Transition:
 Increased number of applicants to be invited t o the jury interview phase and
juries to recommend “GO reserve” for projects to be funded if additional budget
becomes available.
 Seal of Excellence will be awarded to all proposals that meet the evaluation
thresholds but are not funded due to lack of available budget  (previously only
for mono-beneficiary SME proposals). If the proposal is submitted by consortia,
the Seal of Excellence will be awarded to the coordinator of the proposal, listing
the other participating legal entities.
EIC Accelerator:
 The maximum investment component is reduced from EUR 15 million to EUR 10
million (investments amounts above EUR 10 million available under the STEP
call)
 Clarification that applications must have completed all elements of Technology
Readiness Level 5. The evaluation of short proposals (Step 1) will be batched on
a monthly basis with results within 4-6 weeks.
 For proposals submitted through the Open and Challenges Calls, unanimous
approval in case of consensus meetings is required for a jury interview invitation.
 Clarifications that proposals with nuclear applications are eligible in the case of
the EIC Accelerator.

Key features of EIC support
A combination of financial and non-financial support to accelerate and grow EIC
innovations and companies.
The EIC support goes far beyond funding, and it aims at supporting the emergence,
acceleration and growth of EIC innovations and deep tech companies. In order to
further leverage the EIC investments, all EIC Awardees will be provided with access to
a range of externally contracted, bespoke Business Acceleration Services (BAS) at any
stage of development of their activities. The EIC uses its pan-European reach to connect
EIC Awardees with partners from all around Europe and beyond, thereby also
contributing to further develop the innovation ecosystem in Europe by providing
access to and from a deal flow of top-level European innovators.
Proactive project and portfolio management by EIC Programme Managers
Support awarded by the EIC, and in particular by  the EIC Pathfinder, is more than a
one-off funding of a research project. By covering the full innovation cycle, whenever
possible EIC aims to push results to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). Whilst
EIC Pathfinder Awardees will bear no obligation  regarding the development of
innovations as part of their project (beyond the evaluated proposal), the EIC will
encourage and stimulate further maturation of preliminary findings and results by
providing guidance as well as additional and continuous suppo rt, including financial
one.
Moreover, EIC takes a proactive approach of project and programme management ,
performed by EIC Programme Managers, 13 to identify, develop and implement such
technology visions and to nurture potential market -creating innovations out of EIC
funded projects and activities. Proactive management applies to EIC Pathfinder
Challenges, EIC Transition and EIC Accelerator projects and consists of the following:
 The milestones defined by the p roposals for funding will be used to periodically
review the progress. Reviews will assess whether the activities foreseen to reach
the milestone s have been completed and will consider the results and outputs
against the overall objectives. The reviews will be undertaken with support of
independent experts and overseen by EIC Programme Managers for projects within
their portfolios.
 Following the reviews, the EIC support may be continued on the basis  of its
implementation according to the description of action , amendments to the grant

13 Appointed in accordance with point 1.2.2. of Pillar III in Annex I to Council Decision 2021/764, EIC Programme Managers are
temporary staff employed by the Agency to manage one or more EIC Portfolios.
11

agreements may be requested or, in case a project has not met agreed milestones,
it may be suspended/terminated. It can be even terminated if it has completely lost
economic or technological relevance  (in accordance with the grant agreement) .
Reviews may also result in requests for amendments to ongoing or planned
activities or deployment of some necessary Business Acceleration Services (or other
relevant ones, like those from EIT -KICs), including additional coaching days and
access to crucial expertise. For EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition projects, reviews
may also involve an assessment to submit a proposal directly to the EIC Accelerator
under the Fast Track scheme (see Annex 3) or to submit a proposal for additional
Booster grants (see Annex 5). In addition to the reviews, the EIC Awardees will be
expected to keep  the Agency regularly informed of progress and pre -alerted in
case of difficulties.
 The EIC funded projects may be included in one or more thematic or Challenge -
based portfolios of projects (‘EIC Portfolios’), providing the projects with a
productive setting in which to advance their ideas. For EIC Challenges, the portfolio
will reflect the scope of the challenge (“Challenge Portfolio”). Projects to be funded
through EIC Open calls may be requested to join one or more Thematic Portfolios.
 Projects selected under EIC Pathfinder Challenges will work together with
Programme Managers and pursue together as a portfolio a common roadmap for
the Challenge. This roadmap is prepared under the guidance of the EIC programme
Manager and sets out collec tive activities, objectives and milestones.  In order to
take into account relevant changes in science and innovation or the portfolio’s
achievements or consistency, the objectives and roadmap of an EIC Challenge
Portfolio must regularly be assessed and if necessary, revised. Based on any such
revision, the Agency may request to amend the projects’ activities, milestones and
deliverables in accordance with the grant agreement. If a project has been selected
under an EIC Challenge topic, and where no amendment can be agreed upon to
ensure coherence with the updated objectives of the related Challenge Portfolio,
the Agency may suspend or terminate the project  in accordance with the grant
agreement.
 EIC portfolio activities are identified and developed by EIC Programme Managers
in consultation with the EIC Awardees of the projects in the EIC Portfolio, with
relevant Commission services and where appropriate with other interested EIC
Community members and third parties  such as members of the innovation
ecosystem. They aim at developing cooperation within an EIC Portfolio in order to
achieve its objectives, enhance research, prepare transition to innovation and
stimulate business opportunities  understanding and enhancing of regulatory
12

framework, and strengthen the EIC Community. Such activities may cover
participation to conferences, workshops or meetings, experience and data sharing,
and participation to any relevant Business Acceleration Services events.
A tailored approach to proposal evaluation
The EIC approach to the evaluation of proposals is tailored to the objectives of each of
the EIC funding schemes. For the most mature technologies, when business and market
readiness levels are close to market funding, greater emphasis is put on interviews with
applicants and a simplified binary scoring (GO/ NO GO).
For the EIC Pathfinder, which supports science -towards-technology breakthrough
research, the evaluation follows a peer review method where proposals are evaluated,
scored and ranked by experts based on weighted criteria and thresholds (see  Section
II).
For the EIC Transition, which funds innovation activities that go beyond the
experimental proof of concept, proposals will first be evaluated remotely, scored , and
ranked based on criteria and thresholds. For the top ranked applicants which are invited
to the interview, the jury will decide based on a binary scoring (GO/NO GO, see Section
III).
For the EIC Accelerator, which supports high risk/high gain innovations to go to the
market and scale up, proposals will be evaluated remotely and at interviews based on
a binary scoring (GO/NO GO)14 (see Section IV).
For the EIC STEP Scale Up, which supports promising companies developing critical
technologies15, including those with prior EIC support, to help them secure larger
funding rounds for further scaling their businesses (see Section V).
Policy of open access and Intellectual Property rights16
For the EIC Pathfinder, provisions will be applied to ensure open access to scientific
publications and promote the uptake of research results (see Annex 2 on open science).
Moreover, EIC aims to stimulate the cross-fertilisation and exploitation of results from
EIC supported projects. Therefore, EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition projects may be
requested at any stage by EIC Programme Managers to actively share information
about results (including preliminary findings), within their EIC Portfolio and with other

14 In line with Article 28(3) and Article 29(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2021/695) of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme
for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations
(EU) No 1290/2013 and (EU) No 1291/2013, OJ L 170, 12.5.2021, p. 1, (“Horizon Europe Regulation”).

16 For the EIC Accelerator, the Intellectual Property rules are included in the contract and/or investment agreement.
13

relevant EIC projects and  parties, as detailed in Annex 6 . The goal is to stimulate and
nurture potential innovation out of EIC Pathfinder or EIC Transition results and explore
pathways to further development. This exchange of information between EIC Awardees
will be without prejudice to their own legitimate interests to exploit the results or
findings. To ensure full confidentiality, such sharing will be subject to non -disclosure
obligations regarding confidential results, with EIC Awardees retaining the right on a
case-by-case basis to fully disclose or not their intellectual property.
Technology transfer and other relevant support is expected to be provided by
universities and research organisations for exploiting the results of EIC projects. In the
absence of such support and w ithout prejudice to ownership of results , the inventors
of results generated by EIC Pathfinder and Transition projects  may be entrusted with
appropriate access rights for the purpose of further development and exploitation .
Exploitation activities may be eligible to additional financial support and services
offered by the EIC, as further detailed in Annex 5.
Economic security
Following the Communication on the European Economic Security Strategy 17 and the
Commission Recommendation on critical technology areas for the EU's economic
security18 a number of provisions have been made to protect Europe from economic
security risks.
These measures are:
• Eligibility criteria : In line with Art icle 136 of the Financial Regulation 19, where
necessary and  duly justified, legal entities which are directly or indirectly
controlled by a non -eligible third country or by a legal entity established in a
non-eligible third country cannot participate as beneficiaries in Accelerator
grant-only actions 20. This restriction is exceptionally applied and justified in
order to protect the Union’s strategic assets, interests, or security also taking
into account the technological objectives and expected outcomes under the
following calls:

17 Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy: European Economic Security Strategy, 26.06.2023, JOIN (2023) 20 final
18 Commission Recommendation of 03 October 2023 on critical technology areas for the EU's economic security for
further risk assessment with Member States - European Commission (europa.eu)
19 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509
20  The eligibility criteria do not apply to blended finance actions and to equity -only actions because appropriate
controls are implemented for the investment component in the context of the Know Your Customer (KYC) / “Red
Flag” report prior to any EIC Fund i nvestment. In addition, Investment safeguards can be introduced, where
appropriate, in the investment agreements.
14

o specific Challenges under the EIC Accelerator relating to artificial
intelligence and space (see Section IV);
o the STEP scale up call  which supports strategic areas in  Digital
technologies and deep tech , Clean and resource efficient technologies,
Biotechnologies (see Section V).
• Investment safeguards: The inclusion of economic security safeguards in
investment agreements by the EIC Fund for companies selected to receive an
investment component under the EIC Accelerator , if this is deemed necessary ,
in order to safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or
security and to achieve technological objectives and expected outcomes for
companies selected under the EIC STEP Scale up call as well as within the four
priority technology areas defined in the Commission Recommendation on
critical technology areas, namely: advanced semiconductors technologies,
artificial intelligence technologies, quantum technologies and biotechnologies.
The different possible safeg uards are described in the EIC Fund Investment
Guidelines and will be tailored to each specific investee. Where the need for
such safeguard measures is identified in the Commission Single Award Decision,
the EIC Fund Manager will apply at least one of the safeguard measures in the
investment agreement. The assessment by the Commission of the need for
safeguard measures to be identified in the Award Decision will take account of
EU policy developments on economic security, including the application of
safeguards in the main Horizon Europe work programmes (such as those
implemented under Article 22.5 of the Horizon Europe Regulation).
• Intellectual Property: A requirement exists in the grant agreement for all EIC
beneficiaries to inform the Agency in cases where the Intellectual Property
generated by EIC projects is proposed to be transferred to an entity in a non -
associated third country.
Details of the above economic security measures are provided in the call texts below.
EIC investments
The requirements concerning the list of non -cooperative jurisdictions (as amended
from time to time) for tax purposes issued by the Council (OJ C 438, 19.12.2017, p. 5)
(the "Council Conclusions") are applied by the EIC in respect of EIC Accelerator
investments.
15

The EIC Fund shall not enter into any contract or maintain a business relationship with
any institution or individual listed on sanction lists,21 and in particular shall not make
any funds available directly or indirectly to any institution or individual listed in sanction
lists22.
The EIC applies the EU rules, policies and procedures, addressing the requirements in
respect of money laundering, terrorism financing, tax avoidance, tax fraud, tax evasion
contained in Article 15 8(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation 23 and complies with the
prohibition to enter into new or renewed operations with entities incorporated or
established in jurisdictions listed under the relevant Union policy on non -cooperative
jurisdictions or that are identified as high-risk third countries24 or that do not effectively
comply with Union or internationally agreed tax standards on transparency and

EIC-EIT Collaboration
The EIC is progressively increasing collaboration and synergies with the EIT and its
Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) with the overall aim of strengthening
the European Innovation Ecosystem. A number of collaboration areas are already in
place and will continue to be supported under the current Work Programme facilitating
the access to services to European innovators. The Fast Track process by EIT KICs, that
allows proposals from companies selected by the EIT KICs to enter the EIC Accelerator
evaluation at the second stage will continue in 2025; EIC beneficiaries will have access
to the services provided by the EIT KICs via the partnerships agreed with the Business
Acceleration Services. The “Next Generation Innovation Talents” scheme allows EIT
Label Masters and Doctoral programmes, EIT Alumni, EIT Jumpstarter beneficiaries  to
undertake secondments in EIC and EIT supported startups and SMEs. Collaboration will

Outlook for 2026 and future years
The EIC Work Programme for 2026 will be prepared following the advice provided by
the EIC Board. It is envisaged that the main calls on Pathfinder, Transition and
Accelerator will continue without major changes. The experience with the STEP scale
up call will be assessed with a view to the continuation and  improvement of  this
support. The identification of the challenges will draw from the insights of the EIC
Programme Managers and reflect the EU policy priorities. Changes or pilot actions may
be considered following the mid-term review of Horizon Europe.

The Agency entrusted by the European Commission with the implementation of
Horizon Europe EIC activities, except for the EIC Fund, is the European Innovation
Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA).
Deep tech 27 is technology that is based on cutting -edge scientific advances and
discoveries and is characterised by the need to stay at the technological forefront by
constant interaction with new ideas and results from the lab. Deep tech innovations are
understood to be those that have the potential to deliver transformative solutions,
rooted in cutting-edge science, technology and engineering, including innovation that
combines advances in the physical, biological and digital spheres. Deep tech is distinct
from ‘high tech’ which tends to refer only to R&D intensity28.
The EIC Board oversees the strategy and implementation of EIC activities and provides
advice on EIC Work Programmes. It comprises 20 leading innovators and innovative
researchers, as well as a full time President of the EIC Board. The EIC Board is appointed
by the European Commission following an open call for expressions of interest. The EIC
Board members are subject to strict rules concerning conflicts of interest and
confidentiality.

26 These definitions are complemented by specific definitions regarding provisions concerning management of EIC Portfolios and
Intellectual Property for EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition actions detailed in Annex 6.
27 Deep tech ventures have the following characteristics: positioning at the knowledge frontier with long and uncertain R&I cycles;
relates to tangible products and industrialisation processes; linked to the ecosystem and especially higher education institutions,
problem orientated, or mission driven, focused on the creation of an option space and a dynamic de-risking cycle.

II. EIC Pathfinder
The overall objective of the EIC Pathfinder for advanced research is to develop the
scientific basis to underpin breakthrough technologies. It provides support for the
earliest stages of scientific, technological or deep -tech research and development.
Pathfinder projects aim to build on new, cutting -edge directions in science and
technology to disrupt a field and a market or create new opportunities by realising
innovative technological solutions through:
 ‘EIC Pathfinder Open’, open to support projects  in any field of science,
technology or application without predefined thematic priorities.
 ‘EIC Pathfinder Challenges’ to support coherent portfolios of projects  within
predefined thematic areas with the aim to achieve  specific objectives for each
Challenge.
II.1 EIC Pathfinder Open
 Do you have an ambitious vision for a novel future technology that could make
a real difference to our lives?
 Do you see a plausible way of achieving the scientific breakthrough that will
make this technology possible?
 Can you imagine collaborating with an interdisciplinary team of researchers and
innovators to validate the scientific basis of the future technology, realise a proof
of principle, and explore paths to impact?
If the answer to each one of these questions is ‘yes’, then EIC Pathfinder Open may be
the right call for you.
Why should you apply?
You should apply if you are looking for support from EIC Pathfinder Open to realise an
ambitious vision for radically new technology, with potential to create new markets
and/or to provide solutions for global challenges. EIC Pathfinder Open supports early-
stage development of such future technologies (e.g., various activities at low
Technology Readiness Levels from 1 to 4), based on high -risk/high-gain science -
towards-technology breakthrough research (including ‘deep-tech’). This research must
provide the foundations of the technology you are envisioning.
EIC Pathfinder Open may support your work, especially if it is highly risky: you may set
out to try things that will not work; you may be faced with questions that nobody knows
23

the answer to yet; you may realise that there are many aspects of the problem that you
do not master. On the contrary, if the approach you want to follow is incremental by
nature or known, EIC Pathfinder Open will not support you.
Before applying to this call, you should verify that your proposal meets all the following
essential characteristics (‘Gatekeepers’):
 Convincing long-term vision of a radically new technology that has the potential
to have a transformative positive effect to solving a challenge in our economy
and society.
 Concrete, novel and ambitious science -towards-technology breakthrough,
providing advancement towards the envisioned technology.
 High-risk/high-gain research approach and methodology, with concrete and
plausible objectives.
EIC Pathfinder Open involves interdisciplinary research and development. By bringing
diverse areas of research together, often with different perspectives, terminologies and
methodologies, within individual projects and within a portfolio of projects, really new
things can be generated, and entirely new areas of research can be opened up. It is up
to you to compose the team that you need, that you can learn from, and that you can
move forward with.
The expected output of your project is the proof of principle that the main ideas of the
envisioned future technology are feasible, thus validating its scientific and
technological basis. Project results should include top -level scientific publications in
open access. While your vision is expected to be worthwhile because of its potential
for future impact, for instance to create new markets, improve our lives, or provide
solutions for global challenges, these are not expected to be achieved in the course of
your EIC Pathfinder  Open project. However, you are expected to take the necessary
measures in the course of the project to allow future uptake to take place. This includes:
an adequate formal protection of the generated Intellectual Property (IP) 39, a plan for
future exploitation  and an assessment of relevant aspects related to regulation,
certification, and standardisation.
In addition, you are encouraged to involve and empower in your team key actors that
have the potential to become future leaders in their field such as excellent early-career
researchers or promising high -tech SMEs, including start -ups. Your project should
reinforce their mind-set for targeted research and development aimed at high impact

39 IP includes industrial property (patents, trademarks, designs and geographic indications of source) and copyright.
See also Section I and Annex 6 for more information on the EIC policy of Open Access and IP rights.

applied results. This will strengthen Europe’s capacity for exploiting the scientific
discoveries made in Europe throughout the steps to market success or for solving
global challenges. You are particularly encouraged to empower female researchers in
your project and to achieve gender balance among your work package leaders.

II.2 EIC Pathfinder Challenges
EIC Pathfinder Challenges aim to build on new, cutting-edge directions in science and
technology to disrupt a field and a market or create new opportunities by realising
innovative technological solutions grounded in high -risk/high-gain research and
development.
With each specific Challenge, a portfolio of projects will be established that explore
different perspectives, competing approaches or complementary aspects of the
Challenge. The complexity and high -risk nature of this research will require multi -
disciplinary collaborations.
A dedicated Programme Manager, who establishes a common roadmap  and
proactively steers the portfolio towards the goals of each Challenge, oversees a specific
28

EIC Pathfinder Challenge. Projects in a Challenge portfolio are expected to interact and
exchange, remaining flexible and reactive in the light of developments within the
portfolio or in the relevant global scientific or industrial community. They will progress
together towards common goals and create new opportunities for radical innovation.
This section refers to common criteria for all EIC Pathfinder Challenges. Please refer to
the description below of each Challenge for specific information and requirements.
Why should you apply?
You should apply if you have a potential cutting-edge project that would contribute to
the specific objectives of the respective Challenge. Specifically, your proposed project
must aim to deliver by its end the expected outcomes defined in the respective
Challenge. In general, the starting point of a proposal answering to a Pathfinder
Challenge is early TRL (e.g.,  2) to up to proof of concept or validation in the lab (e.g.,
TRL 3 or 4). Project results should also include top -level scientific publications ,
adequate formal protection of the generated intellectual property (IP)  as well as an
assessment of relevant aspects related to regulation, certification and standardisation.
In addition, you are encouraged to involve and empower in your team key actors that
have the potential to become future leaders in their fields such as excellent early-career
researchers or promising high -tech SMEs, including start -ups. Your proposed project
should reinforce the mind-set for targeted research and development aimed at high -
impact applied results. This will strengthen Europe’s capacity for exploiting the
scientific discoveries made in Europe throughout the steps to market success or for
solving global challenges. You are particularly encouraged to empower female
researchers in your project and to achieve gender balance among your work package
leaders.
Before you decide to apply, you are strongly encouraged to read the respective EIC
Pathfinder Challenge Guide that will be published on the EIC website and the Funding
& Tenders Portal after the call opening. The Challenge Guide will provide you with
more information about the objectives of the Challenges, technical information
underpinning the objectives and portfolio considerations used for the final selection of
proposals to be funded.
Can you apply?
In order to apply, your proposal must meet the general eligibility requirements (see
Annex 2) as well as specific eligibility requirements for the Challenge (if applicable).
Please check for particular elements ( e.g., specific application focus or technology) in
the respective Challenge chapter below.
29

The EIC Pathfinder Challenges support collaborative or individual research and
innovation from consortia or from single legal entities established in a Member State
or an Associated Country (unless stated otherwise in the specific Challenge chapter). In
case of a consortium your proposal must be submitted by the coordinator on behalf
of the consortium. Consortia of two entities must be comprised of independent legal

networks (5G, post -5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European
communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European
communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1).
The standard admissibility and eligibility conditions and the eligibility of applicants
from third countries are detailed in Annex 2.
The scope of proposals should be in line with the Do No Significant Harm principle (see
Annex 2).
What support will you receive if your proposal is funded?
The total indicative budget for this call is EUR 120 million which is expected to be
allocated in approximately equal shares across the Challenges.
You will receive a grant for a Research and Innovation Action to cover the eligible costs,
necessary for the implementation of your project, including the portfolio activities. For
this call, the EIC considers proposals with an EU contribution of up to EUR 4 million as
appropriate. Nonetheless, this does not preclude you to request larger amounts, if duly
justified or stated otherwise in the specific Challenge.
The funding rate of this grant will be 100% of the eligible costs. Eligible costs will take
the form of a lump sum and the amount will be determined during the evaluation
process. Applicants must therefore propose the amount of the lump sum based on
their estimated project costs as defined in the Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the
use of lump sum contributions under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework
30

Programme for Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2021-
2025).43 It is advised to include a work package dedicated to portfolio activities and
allocate at least 10 person-month to it.
In addition to funding, successful applicants will receive tailor -made access to a wide
range of Business Acceleration Services  (see Section V) and interactions with EIC
Programme Managers and other actions in the portfolio of projects selected (see
Section I).
Projects funded through EIC Pathfinder (including grants resulting from certain EIC
pilot Pathfinder, FET-Open and Proactive calls)44 may be eligible:
 to receive Booster grants of a fixed amount not exceeding EUR 50 000 to undertake
complementary activities to explore potential pathways to commercialisation or for
portfolio activities (see Annex 5);

31

Sections 1 to 3 of the part B of your proposal, corresponding respectively to the award
criteria Excellence, Impact, and Quality and Efficiency of the Implementation, must
consist of a maximum of 30 format A4 pages.
You will be informed about the outcome of the evaluation  by 5 months after call
deadline (indicative), and, if your proposal is accepted for funding, you can expect your
grant agreement to be signed by 8 months after the call deadline (indicative).
How does the EIC decide if your proposal will be funded?
After the submission of your proposal, it will be evaluated in two steps:
1. The EIC expert evaluators will assess each proposal separately against the award
criteria and the EIC evaluation committee will ensure consistency across scores.
2. The EIC evaluation committee will consider all proposals passing the first step
together in order to assess the best portfolio of projects to achieve the specific
objectives of the Challenge (so called portfolio considerations). The evaluation
committee will be composed of EIC expert evaluators and EIC Programme
Managers.
Step1 (assessment of each proposal separately):
Your proposal will be first evaluated and scored individually by at least three EIC expert
evaluators with respect to the award criteria. After the individual evaluation, these
evaluators will get together in a consensus group to agree on a common position on
comments and scores.
After the consensus Phase, the evaluation committee will check consistency across the
evaluation of each individual proposal and finalise the scores and comments for all
proposals.
For step 1, proposals will be assessed according to the following award criteria (Table
3).
Table 3. Award criteria for EIC Pathfinder Challenges
Excellence (Threshold: 4/5; weight 60%)
Objectives and relevance to the Challenge : How clear are the project’s objectives? How
relevant are they in contributing to the overall goal and the specific objectives of the
Challenge?
Novelty: To what extent is the proposed work ambitious and goes beyond the state-of-the-
art?
32

extent does the applicant / do all consortium members have the necessary capacity and high
quality expertise for performing the project tasks?

All proposals that meet the thresholds defined in the award criteria will be considered
in step 2.
Step 2 (portfolio considerations):
In step 2 , the evaluation committee will consider each proposal’s contribution to
setting up a consistent Challenge Portfolio of projects.
First, the evaluation committee will map the proposals in a number of categories
stemming from the overall goal and specific objectives of the Challenge . Examples of
33

possible categories are: building blocks or subsystems, technical areas and/or
competing technologies, platforms, applications areas, risk level  and stage of
technology readiness level, size, etc.
Following this mapping of proposals against categories, a  suitable portfolio of
proposals will be selected by the evaluation committee by applying portfolio
considerations in order to propose for funding  a coherent set of projects that will
achieve the expected outcomes and impacts of the Challenge and maximise their
impact.
Further information and details about the categories and the portfolio considerations
will be provided in EIC Pathfinder Challenge Guides 46, which will be topic and domain
specific.
The evaluation committee may also propose some minor adjustments to the proposals
as far as needed for the consistency of the portfolio approach. These adjustments will
be in conformity with the conditions for participation and comply with the principle of
equal treatment.
You will receive feedback in the Evaluation Summary Report which will comprise the
final score and the comments endorsed by the evaluation committee as well as any
additional comments. If your proposal was either retained for funding or not retained
for funding while it received a score that was higher than other proposals retained for
funding under the same Challenge, then you will also be informed about the underlying
portfolio considerations. Comments on the detailed lump sum budget table will be
provided in the Evaluation Summary Report only for proposals invited to grant
agreement preparation or placed in the reserve list or rejected (possibly in part) due to
significant overestimation or underestimation of costs.
What happens after a proposal is evaluated and retained for funding?
The applicant/coordinator of the proposal will receive a letter announcing the proposal
has been retained for funding and the next steps regarding grant agreement signature.
Grant agreement preparation and signature is expected to be completed within three
months, but shorter timelines may be specified.
The EIC Project Officer and relevant EIC Programme Manager will contact applicants
and provide support during the grant agreement preparation to plan the portfolio
activities which y will be expected to  entail collaboration between projects within the
Challenge Portfolio, and to start the preparation of the Challenge roadmap which will

34

define the collective deliverables, activities and objectives of the portfolio of projects
selected.
During the execution of the project, you will interact continuously with the EIC Project
Officer assigned to your project and the EIC Programme Manager, assigned to the
Challenge Portfolio of your project, who will oversee all the portfolio projects.
II.2.1 Biotech for Climate Resilient Crops and Plant-Based Biomanufacturing
Background and scope
Land based agricultural production is the source of approximately 95% of human food
nutrients (UN FAO). Intensive and often inappropriate practices in agriculture have
however resulted in severe soil degradation, thereby reducing the capacity of soils to
support food production and other important ecosystem services such as the
regulation of water, nutrients, and carbon cycles. Soil degradation is further accelerated
by the effects of climate change, with abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, salinity,
and waterlogging, often in combination, having negative effects on the world’s crop
production. The direct impact of a changed climate is also frequently accompanied by
indirect impacts due to alterations in the composition and behaviour of weeds, insects,
pathogens, and soil microbiome, alongside the impacts of increased amounts of
human-generated pollutants.
Plants react to such stresses with what are often conflicting physiological and metabolic
responses. These may prioritise one acclimatisation/adaptation strategy over the other,
a blend of one or more responses, and/or through developing a completely new
strategy, all of which can, in turn, impact final production including nutrient content.
When combined with an increasing human population, likely to increase net demand
for food, there is a clear rationale to reinforce existing food and nutrient production
systems and explore complementary routes to food production that are more efficient,
resilient, sustainable and maintain or increase biodiversity.
This Pathfinder Challenge therefore aims to support projects that enhance adaptation
pathways for the production of climate -resilient crops and develop alternative
pathways to produce high value ingredients in plants by increasing nutrient profile of
crops based on plant native and/or non-native ingredients.
Specific Objectives
Innovative ideas put forward under this Challenge must go beyond incremental
changes to the state -of-the-art and result in novel production processes that must
deliver energy- and resource-efficient, low emission foods that maintain or increase
biodiversity and are integral to a healthy diet.
35

Funded projects are expected to develop breakthrough technologies that reach TRL4
(validation in laboratory environment) with viable plants at the end of the projects. The
proposals should work on both the following objectives:
• Increasing plant growth, yields and resistance to stress through:
o Enhancing tolerance to stress combinations occurring due to different
climate scenarios that include the simultaneous exposure of crops to
different stresses e.g. heat combined with drought, salinity, flooding, high
CO2 levels, as well as indirect effect of climate change via altered
composition and behaviour of weeds, insects, pathogens and soil
microbiome and possible impact of human-generated pollutants.
o Increasing water use efficiency and nutrient use efficiency compared to
current crops in commercial use.
o Improving plant reproduction and seed filling processes under
unfavourable conditions caused by combination of at least two stress
factors.
o Investigating and enhancing plant and soil microbiome interactions.
• Substantially increasing the nutritional value ( e.g. proteins, vitamins) in crops
through plant native and non-native ingredients in crops.
Projects must also develop a complete methodology for assessing the increase of plant
growth, yields, and climate resilience to single and multiple stresses, and/or assess
changes to the nutritional value of crops, as appropriate. Proposals should include
multi-omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics and phenomics. These approaches can be further underpinned by
leveraging technologies such as, but not limited to nanoparticle technology, chemistry,
and advanced artifici al intelligence to develop and introduce novel defence and
acclimation strategies, currently not present in crops to achieve greater tolerance to
harsh environmental conditions and/or biomanufacturing of non-native ingredients, to
enable the time required for that development to be significantly shortened. Proposals
should also look to address the narrow genetic diversity of novel crops and are also
expected to consider regulatory aspects and to build on the work carried out so far by
the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA), where appropriate.

36

Expected Outcomes and Impacts:
In support of Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and
Biomanufacturing in the EU 47, the Mission Soil48, the EU Green Deal 49, Farm to Fork
strategy50, the Nature Restoration Law51, Fit for 5552, and REPowerEU53 policy actions,
the key overall goal of this Challenge is to support the production of sustainable and
nutritious food from plants.
This Challenge aims to  support the  development of climate smart crops and  the
production of high value plant native and non -native ingredients in a cost -effective
and environmentally friendly manner. In the medium to long-term this will:
• Improve the sustainability, efficiency, biodiversity and resilience of the European
food supply chain.
• Secure long-term competitiveness of EU Food supply chain while decreasing EU
dependency on imports of inputs for primary production, feed, and food.
The following principles will be used to select the portfolio of projects:
i. Selected projects for the portfolio should have a synergy with  one another in
terms of a common component, for instance projects address similar stress
factors for different crops or are leveraging a similar technology.
ii. A balanced representation of native and non-native ingredients.
iii. A balanced representation of conventional and New Genomic Techniques
(NGTs).
iv. Diverse type of crops to ensure that the portfolio covers a broad spectrum, if
possible, ensuring European geographical coverage where these crops are
grown.
v. Diverse stress factor combinations to ensure that a broad spectrum of stress
factors is covered.
vi. Diversity in technological approaches to compare their efficiency.

II.2.2 Generative-AI based Agents to Revolutionize Medical Diagnosis and
Treatment of Cancer
Background and scope
Imaging is a crucial component of cancer clinical protocols, providing detailed
morphological, structural, metabolic, and functional information. However, harnessing
the full potential of the data generated through medical imaging in clinical settings
remains challenging. Clinicians often struggle to combine diverse and large-scale data
into a comprehensive view of patient care, disease progression, and treatment efficacy.
The inability to seamlessly integrate and interpret diverse data sources result in
suboptimal patient outcomes and inefficiencies in the delivery of healthcare.
The integration of traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) with medical imaging can
transform healthcare, but most existing applications are still in their infancy and must
overcome a number of challenges to accelerate adoption. These include AI applications
being confined to single data modalities, which restricts their overall effectiveness
(Monomodal Application); inadequate and insufficient data training, leading to data
scarcity and a lack of generalizability, making them less reliable across diverse patient
populations, including with regard to gender -sensitivity; and the lack of AI model
interpretability, as many AI systems function as "black boxes," providing little insight
into their decision -making processes. This lack of transparency limits trust in the
systems and their usability in clinical settings.
The goal of this Pathfinder Challenge is to create interactive GenAI autonomous agents
and/or a combination of them (super-agent) that provide clinicians with a holistic end
to end perspective of patient care, throughout the entire clinical pathway. These agents
aim to enhance pattern identification, reduce inconsistencies and errors in diagnoses
as well as improve cancer treatment. While the focus is on GenAI, we also encourage
the integration of other advanced AI technologies, such as topological and geometric
deep learning, neural fields, graph neural networks, etc., which can complement and
enhance the robustness and effectiveness of GenAI-based solutions in addressing the
challenges of cancer diagnosis and therapy.
The Challenge will support early -stage groundbreaking research projects that will
develop and validate novel approaches and concepts for integrating and interpreting
multimodal medical imaging and health data . Additionally, it will involve generating
38

reliable synthetic medical data, which will also be pooled to form a common database
and used for the development of advanced algorithms.
Specific Objectives
Project proposals under this Challenge should focus on one (and only one) of the
following diseases: breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, lung
cancer, brain cancer, stomach cancer or colorectal cancer.
Each proposal should address both the following areas (at least one sub-objective from
each of the areas):
Area 1: Technological area
i. GenAI-based tools for Integrating Multidimensional Multimodal health Data
Investigate groundbreaking techniques and methodologies for developing GenAI
algorithms that combine multidimensional (e.g. time dimension, space dimension)
and multimodal data from various sources. These include  multiple imaging
modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, X-ray), clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, lab
results, structured and unstructured clinical data, pathology results, genetics and –
omics data, videos, knowledge databases, and other resources) . The goal is  to
provide a comprehensive view of the patient’s condition. The developed algorithms
should be capable of producing unified and actionable datasets that can be
exploited for the development of the AI tools described in Area 2 (clinical).
ii. Medical Data Augmentation
Develop GenAI models based on groundbreaking techniques that are in the
conceptual or initial experimental phase for medical data augmentation . These
models should be capable of creating highly realistic synthetic medical data
(images, genomics data, etc.)  and generating complementary data from existing
sources (for example producing synthetic CT images from MRI images), to support
iterative cycles of model training.
iii. Medical Knowledge Representation and Integration
Create an initial prototype GenAI model for medical knowledge representation and
integration. This model should aim to develop  a comprehensive and dynamic
medical knowledge base, to identify discrete medical imaging features associated
with demographic information and systemic conditions, to improve the
interpretability of AI -based models and extract new knowledge not previously
identifiable by experts without assistance.
Area 2: Clinical Area
39

i. Predictive Diagnosis
Develop an interactive autonomous agent capable of assessing the likelihood of a
patient developing cancer by analysing their medical history, imaging data, and
genetic information. The agent should provide personalised health risk predictions,
enabling early detection and preventive measures.
ii. Enhance Personalized Treatment Selection
Develop novel AI algorithms and architectures that leverages multidimensional and
multimodal data integration , along with synthetic data generation, to predict the
optimal treatment pathway for specific patient condition s, as well as  to forecast
disease progression and treatment efficacy providing a comprehensive view of
patient care.
Appropriate performance metrics should be considered for the continuous evaluation
and testing of the scientific and technical robustness (including accurately quantify
uncertainties) of all developed algorithms and architectures in Areas 1 and 2. Rigorous
testing against diverse datasets is essential to ensure that the models perform reliably
across various patient demographics and conditions, thereby reducing the risk of
skewed results and ensuring precision from diagnoses to therapy.
Projects should also conduct proof of concept studies in controlled settings to
demonstrate improved and more accurate diagnosis and treatment when compared to
current clinical practice . T he viability of the developed technologies should be
evaluated, guiding further refinement and improvement. For instance, a  super-agent
could be validated for assisting and/or replacing clinicians through the whole clinical
pathway of the patient, providing a holistic view of patient care, that is currently
unachievable due to fragmented healthcare systems and associated expertise.
The focus should also be on enhancing the interpretability of AI models/agents, making
their decision-making processes more transparent and understandable to clinicians.
This could involve developing cutting -edge techniques such as causal inference
methods, explainable AI frameworks, or novel visualization tools that provide deeper
insights into AI decision-making processes.
The AI models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU
concept for Trustworthy AI54, relevant ethical principles55, and the AI Act56. In addition

56Regulation - EU - 2024/1689 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)

40

to focusing on performance, careful attention must be given to data quality,
transparency, privacy, and security.
Proposers are encouraged to leverage the data and tools available in the Cancer Image
Europe platform57 (deployed in the context of the European Cancer Imaging Initiative58)
for their proposed work. In turn they should contribute the datasets, and developed AI
tools and models to the platform under agreed conditions. All datasets produced
should be described where possible with metadata records in the EU dataset catalogue
of the European Health Data Space  (EHDS) using the Health DCAT -AP59 metadata
standard 60
Projects that address only one of the two ‘Areas’ or other cancer types will be
considered "out" of scope.
Expected Outcomes and Impacts:
In support of the European AI Strategy 61 and the Cancer Plan for Europe 62 and the
Cancer Mission 63 this Challenge looks to support the the development of the next
generation models for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with Generative AI.
This Challenge aims to create a collaborative environment where diverse expertise  —
including for example data science, informatics, oncology, radiology, pathology,
medical physics , bioinformatics, geneticists, healthcare administrators, and patient
advocacy groups — converges to address the complexities of developing autonomous
agents for holistic patient care, through enhanced diagnosis and personalized
treatment.
The Challenge aspires to significantly improve patient care and reduce pressure on the
healthcare system by leveraging advanced interactive autonomous agents for
diagnosis and personalized treatment. By alleviating the burdens on clinicians and
ensuring compliance with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI, the initiative will enhance
the quality and reliability of medical services. Economically, it promises substantial cost
reductions and cost avoidance, leading to long -term improvements in healthcare
efficiency and sustainability. Ultimately, this challenge will foster innovation and

establish Europe as a leader in the field, delivering profound benefits to patients,
healthcare providers, and society at large.
The portfolio of selected projects will be designed to deliver a set of agents/models for
improved diagnosis and personalized treatment of the above -mentioned cancers.
Specifically, the projects will collaborate to:
- Create a shared database of synthetically generated images to be used across
all projects for the development of their algorithms;
- Compare the use of a combination of the agents in the case of multiple cancers;
- Benchmark agents for enhanced diagnosis and personalized treatment
selection;
- Define innovative clinical pathways in oncology;
- Externally validate the developed agents within a project at clinical premises of
another project in the portfolio;
- Develop standardized methods and frameworks for evaluating AI - Act and
Medical Device Regulation (MDR)- compliant generative AI models.
The portfolio of projects to be funded under this Challenge will be composed in such
a way that they address ideally all cancers mentioned in this call, apply different
technologies, and provide access to relevant clinical facilities and research
infrastructures. The following categories will be used for the composition:
Category 1 – type of cancer
Category 2 – type of technology
Category 3 – access to appropriate infrastructure data and ecosystem
integration.
Specific conditions
Applications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European
communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution
of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection
of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1)
II.2.3 Towards autonomous robot collectives delivering collaborative tasks in
dynamic unstructured construction environments
Background and scope
Robotic automation  offers significant advantages to several sectors,  yet o n-site
construction robotics is amongst the most challenging and least understood fields in
robotics. The unstructured, dynamic environment with human  presence makes
42

navigation and automation of the many concurrent construction tasks deeply
challenging. Further, the c urrent state -of-the-art solutions focus on adding higher
degrees of automation to legacy tools , such as heavy equipment designed for diesel
engines and human operators.
Radical innovations are essential for the sector to address the unprecedented wave of
building growth, especially in the context of labour shortages, a productivity gap
between the construction and other industries, rising expectations for occupational
health and safety, and the need for healthier and more affordable living environments.
Through the collaboration of multiple agents (both humans and machines)
construction processes can be accelerated, enabling more complex processes with
multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously and collaboratively. Multi -robotic
collaboration, where robotic agents support and complement each other’s tasks and
skill sets within the same workspace, may unlock entirely new processes that are not
possible using single robotic machines. This approach could involve multiple
distributed “swarms” of collaborati ve robots using distributed control algorithms  and
robot learning systems, which may be better suited to large, spatially distributed tasks
and can adapt to unpredictable environments. Doing so while also supporting the
electrification of the (legacy suite of) construction equipment, will help break with the
need to go for ever  larger machines and facilitate the development of novel
technologies that enable efficient accurate and reliable control , and the adoption  of
collaborative robots that are suitable f or commercial on -site construction
environments.
Realising the disruptive potential of novel emerging technolog y paradigms that
reconsider construction processes from the fundamentals can help supplant and
substitute the legacy suite of tools with novel autonomous collaborative construction
robots in an integrated, “designed-for-robotics” digital production and assembly chain.
Such developments could also further enhance an emerging paradigm shift from
today’s complex mix of on -site construction tasks, towards a future of off -site
fabrication and on -site assembly. Off -site fabrication offers industrial economic
advantages of producing modularized building elements at scale in a controlled,
digitalized and automated factory environment. For the construction sector this
paradigm shift can deliver demand-side emissions reduction s, by implementing
strategies of digitalized structural  efficiency and novel materials, as well as of zero -
emission construction sites through electrification.
This Pathfinder Challenge aims to address all construction tasks typically required for
site preparation, substructure, and superstructure, as well as the coordination between
43

these tasks to support a transition towards building with autonomous electrified
construction equipment. It includes the role of human agents in construction
processes, as even high degrees of multi -robotic autonomy with low degrees of
supervision will require a collaborative connection between human and robotic agents,
ensuring they can safely collaborate and share the same workspace.
Specific objectives
The overall objective of this Challenge is the development of breakthrough
technologies in the domain of autonomous collaborative on -site construction robots
for an integrated, designed-for-robotics, digital production and assembly chain.
The Challenge is open to the 3 main construction tasks applied to the 2 main
construction segments of buildings and infrastructure. Innovative application in
adjacent construction segments (for example coastal protection foundations for energy
infrastructure) also fall within scope.
Each funded project shall deliver the following 3 specific objectives:
Objective 1:
Development of a simplified structural , load-bearing, material-robot building system
to assemble a representative and future-relevant structure (pavilion) using a multitude
of discrete modules (elements, segments, blocks, voussoirs) . This system  must
demonstrate TRL4 (validation in laboratory environment) of the autonomous
collaborative multirobotic assembly. The structure can represent an infrastructure (for
example a bridge, tunnel, culvert, conduit), a building (for example a tower, vault, dome,
arch, mu lti-story skeleton, wall) or other construction elements (for example a
foundation, secant wall, barrier, sea wall). The building system can also integrate
unprocessed and pre -processed in-situ building materials (rocks, sand, natural
materials, demolition materials, disassembled elements ). Projects are expected to
demonstrate the technologies at least at a relevant human scale in terms of volume ,
mass and moment of inertia, and ideally at a larger real-world architectural scale, rather
than at a laboratory desktop scale.
Solutions are expected to incorporate “design-for-robotic-assembly” aspects, such as
the robot -material interfaces, module interfaces  and connectors, and may  include
innovative approaches such as embedded sensing in the modules.
A virtual simulation of the disassembled state, various intermediate assembly stages
(including temporary (robotic) support measures if necessary) and final assembled
state is expected to be part of the systems development process.  The project should
include a documented validation of key design decisions (for example materials used
44

or configurations that simulate scaled behaviour) against the minimal requirements of
the TRL4 demonstration objectives of the autonomous mobile multi -robotic
collaborative platform.
Objective 2:
Development of an autonomous mobile multi -robotic collaborative platform using at
least two, preferably more, mutually aware collaborative robotic systems specifically
designed for the assembly tasks outlined in Objective  1. This objective requires a
structured systems engineering approach to conduct a thorough functional system
analysis and to allocate system-level functions between humans and machines within
the target autonomous mobile multi-robotic collaborative platform.
The design should include the definition of system states and modes , along with the
transitions between them , to ensure safe autonomous operations and effective
demonstration of robot -robot and human -robot collaborations and interactions
(passive, active, adaptive) at TRL4.
The project should also describe how the proposed technology can be scaled to meet
the full dimensions of the intended commercial application in future.
Utilizing existing industrial robots or modifying suitable existing construction tools is
allowed. However, these approaches may face workspace limitations when scaled to
full commercial dimensions. Conversely, novel relative multi -robotic platforms could
make full use of the opportunities of the material-robot system independent of scaling
limitations in future.
Objective 3:
Achieve a TRL4 d emonstration of an autonomous assembly sequence using the
demonstration building system developed in Objective 1, executed by the autonomous
mobile multi -robotic collaborative platform  developed in Objective  2. The
demonstration of a subsequent disassembly sequence is optional but encouraged if
the building system is designed for disassembly. The demonstration will take place in
a laboratory environment, including tests that explore the system’s resilience and limits
under controlled unstructured real -world conditions (for example fault tolerance,
granular uneven surfaces, environmental obstacles) . These tests aim to identify key
weaknesses and recommend future technology developments.
The specific objective of this challenge is to advance the digitalized chain of off -site
modular production with on -site autonomous mobile multi -robotic collaborative
assembly. Therefore, on-site 3D-printing of cementitious materials or polymers as a
primary construction task is outside the scope of this challenge.
45

Expected Outcomes and Impacts:
This Challenge contributes to the European Green Deal 64, the European AI Strategy65,
and the key strategic orientations of Horizon Europe 66 for the digital and green
transitions of the construction sector. The anticipated impacts of this Challenge include
addressing likely shortages and competition in the labour markets, enhancing
productivity and competitiveness within the construction indus try, and improving
worker safety. It will facilitate a shift towards offsite industrial fabrication coupled with
onsite assembly and disassembly, reducing emissions from on -site construction
activities, and lowering costs and mitigating risks associated with construction projects.
This Challenge will also serve as a lighthouse for industrialization in important policy
areas, such as affordable housing, the renovation wave, circular construction, and
infrastructure development.
The field of mobile construction robotics, in particular heterogeneous collaborative
robots assembling discrete building elements, is challenging and multi -disciplinary.
Given the nascent state of the enabling technologies , the cumulative impact of the
portfolio of Pathfinder projects is expected to surpass that of individual projects .
Consortia will benefit from mutual learning and the exchange of approaches and
expertise in areas such as mapping, navigating and building awareness of unstructured
environments, force -aware manipulation, swarm collectives , as well as
commercialisation pathways.
Furthermore, consortia will be encouraged to collaborate on developing performance
metrics and communicate their outputs to the broader public with a view to
accelerating the adoption of these radical innovations by the sector. Such valuable joint
portfolio activities are anticipated to be discussed and agreed upon by the funded
projects.
The portfolio of projects selected will aim to cover a complementary set of projects
that span the “application” and “approach” fields specified below and combinations
thereof:
- Applications fields (super -structure, sub -structure, site -preparation, building,
infrastructure, other construction, target type of environment).
- Approach (type of robot, number of agents, coordination strategy, level of
autonomy, strategy for stability during assembly sequence, multi -modal
sensors, resilience strategy for environmental variability, type of discrete
building elements and fixations, level of integration of material-robot system).

Specific conditions
Applications for this Challenge with elements that concern the evolution of European
communication networks (5G, post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution
of European communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection
of European communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1)
II.2.4 Waste-to-value devices: Circular production of renewable fuels, chemicals
and materials
Background and scope
Fossil fuels supply a majority of the world’s energy and also provide the raw materials,
or feedstocks, for many essential everyday products. While energy provision is
becoming increasingly decarbonized, the production of fuels, chemicals and materials
requires carbon atoms as feedstocks. However, their production can be “de-fossilized”,
by utilising renewable energy and alternative carbon sources. Likewise, a circular
economy approach offers scope to reduce external dependencies and source other
essential molecular feedstocks including critical raw materials from wastes.
This Pathfinder Challenge therefore focuses on the development of next generation
technologies that turn today’s problematic waste streams into essential building blocks
of a future circular economy. Furthermore, it specifically focusses on currently non - or
hard-to-recycle types of synthetic polymer materials (including among other mixtures
of different types of plastics, polymeric composite  materials, micro -/nanoplastics,
untreated plastic waste, diapers, rubber, etc.), flue gases , wastewater and seawater
desalination brines. Proposals must target real-life industrial and household waste
streams where current recycling methods face insurmountable barriers e.g., due to
impurities, the presence of noxious additives, inseparable material mixtures or non -
biodegradable materials. An important side effect is the remediation of waste streams
with respect to micro-/nanoplastics, trace metals and noxious substances. These novel
technologies should be scalable, easily applicable and deliver products with higher
economic value as compared to waste destruction.
The scope of technological solutions addressed in this Challenge is limited to the
following technologies with currently low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), where
significant synergies by working in a Challenge portfolio are expected: solar
47

reforming67 and synthetic biology devices, brine mining 68 and integrated capture and
conversion technologies69. Microbial-based and photocatalytic remediation processes
are included as well. Computational material science and AI, and bottom -up synthetic
biology are supported as key enablers at the fundamental research level.
Thermochemical approaches (such as pyrolysis or gasification) and “dark” (not light -
driven) chemical recycling are out-of-scope of this Pathfinder Challenge. Likewise, food
and biomass waste, traditional bulk metal waste, glass, paper, cardboard and mono -
PET waste are also out of scope.
Specific objectives
The Challenge seeks ambitious proposals that address one (and only one) of the
following focus areas:
Area 1: Fully integrated waste-to-value devices
This includes 1) devices for converting waste streams into (feedstock for) fuels,
chemicals and materials  and 2) devices for remediation; where processes are  solely
driven by renewable energy sources (preferably directly by sunlight) and focus  on the
selective production of added value products, beyond hydrogen as the sole end
product:
(i) Fully integrated solar reforming or synthetic biology devices,
enabling the treatment of synthetic polymer materials, while delivering
fast and efficient decomposition under sustainable reaction conditions
(including the use of process chemicals).
(ii) Integrated capture and conversion technologies , capturing and
converting feedstock from flue gases, or wastewater in a single step/
single device into fuels, chemicals and materials, providing increased
energy- and materials efficiency as compared to not fully integrated
process chains.
(iii) Membrane-based and electrochemical brine mining technologies
recovering raw materials, CO 2 and water from seawater desalinisation
brines.

67 Solar reforming: Sunlight-driven transformation of waste substrates into valuable chemical products facilitated by
a photocatalyst and utilising a wide range of the solar spectrum, including solar catalytic reforming (UV and VIS)
and solar thermal reforming (IR). It thus goes beyond: Photolysis (polymer degradation under direct light irradiation
with very long treatment times), Photocatalytic decomposition (photolysis facilitated by photocatalyst), or
Photoreforming (Light -driven reforming using classical photocatalysts absorbing high -energy UV or near -UV
radiation only).
68 Brine mining: Recovery of useful materials dissolved in seawater desalinization brine.
69 Integrated capture and conversion: the capture of a molecule, e.g., CO2, from a waste stream is directly coupled
with its direct utilization, i.e. conversion, within a single device.
48

(iv) Ex-situ remediation devices based on microbial/enzymatic and/or
photocatalytic degradation, both purifying wastewater and seawater of
noxious substances, metals, or nano -/microplastics, and producing
added value remediation products. This should take place in a reactor,
not in the open field.
Proposals addressing only parts of the full waste-to-value process (e.g., half reactions)
will not be considered.  Integrated hybrid approaches, at the interface of various
disciplines, and autonomously operating devices continuously optimized with AI, are
particularly welcome. The resulting devices must reach TRL 4 within the 3 –4-year
project lifetime.
The associated processes must not down-cycle the waste substrate but create products
of higher economic and environmental value as compared to the initial waste stream.
They must be energy and material -efficient and fully sustainable, minimising the
associated energy, water, chemicals and land footprint. Operating conditions (e.g.,
related to temperature, pressure and the use of additional chemicals) should be
optimised and the circular use of process consumables, such as water, catalyst materials
or chemic al additives maximised. They must deploy environmentally safe, stable
materials, with non -toxic degradation products and the developed devices must be
recyclable-by-design.
Proposals must take a holistic view of the complete waste valorisation chain by
optimising the different elements (pre-treatment, conversion, product separation and
storage) with respect to one another. The systems must also be robust and easy -to-
handle to allow operations that are independent from large-scale infrastructures, with
extended lifetimes and a capability to treat real -life waste streams which have
undergone minimal sorting and pre-treatment.
Proposals have to clearly indicate how the proposed solution benchmarks  against
industrially deployed recycling methods such as mechanical recycling, composting,
biogas fermentation or waste -to-energy technologies, and emerging recycling
methods such as chemical recycling or thermochemical approaches.
Area 2: Understanding underlying mechanisms by means of computational
material science and AI
Projects in this focus area must deliver advances and scientific breakthroughs in the
fundamental understanding of the underlying physical, chemical, and biological
processes that will enable fully sustainable and scalable waste -to-value devices.
Projects should address all the following specific objectives:
49

- Explore fundamental phenomena crucial to multiple waste -to-value device
types, such as the development of efficient, stable and inexpensive catalysts,
interface engineering and the effect of the surrounding medium.
- Develop more accurate and less resource-intensive quantum mechanical and
AI methods to guide, predict and interpret reliably experimental works.
- Bridge the scales from describing properties at the atomic, mesoscopic level
up to the macroscopic device level within a multiscale approach and describe
phenomena over different timescales.
- Adopt a holistic approach to exploring phenomena applicable to multiple
waste-to-value device types (aligned with Area 1). Devices stemming from
Area 1 should serve to validate the developed theoretical models.
Area 3: Cells from scratch by means of bottom-up synthetic biology
Projects in this area must look to deliver scientific breakthroughs in bottom -up
synthetic biology to enable the use of tailored microbial cell factories for the
degradation and valorisation of waste and the production of fossil-free fuels, chemicals,
and materials. Projects should address all the following specific objectives:
- Develop synthetic, fully artificial cells for future large -scale biotechnology
applications, tailored to deliver desired functionalities such as carbon fixation
or synthetic polymer decomposition.
- Engineer cell-like systems to produce compounds from abundantly available
building blocks, such as water and carbon oxides.
- Engineer cell-like systems to decompose diverse types of waste, in particular
synthetic plastic waste, into compounds that are valorisable as feedstock for
a downstream production of fuels, chemicals and materials. At this stage,
systems will not have to be completely autonomous and self-replicating, but
the integration of different modules should be implemented.
Expected outcomes and impacts
This Challenge is in line with REPowerEU70 and Fit for 55 71. It is compliant with the
Renewable Energy Directive 72, the Waste Framework Directive 73 and the Critical Raw
Materials Act74. It supports the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) 75 and the

herein included Plastics strategy . It builds on the Industrial Carbon Management
strategy76, the Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles 77, and the Directive on
the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources78.
The portfolio of projects selected under this Challenge are expected to collectively
cover Areas 1, 2 and 3. A maximum of one proposal from each of Areas 2 and 3 will be
selected, whereas the aim for Area 1 is to select proposals that cover as many device
categories (i-iv) as possible. Combining these three aspects into a single portfolio with
close interaction between the projects and a commonly developed vision is expected
to significantly speed up the innovation journey by driving synergies and mutual
learning.
The resulting portfolio of projects will in time contribute to:
- Local energy and resource supply, allowing communities and remote areas to have
access to reliable and sustainable waste recycling, supporting the local production
of fuels, chemicals and materials. Reduction/ eventual independence from the
importation of critical raw materials in the context of increasing demand for such
materials for renewable energy and fuel technologies.
- Increased share of recycled waste, minimizing waste disposal in open dumps,
landfills and incineration and the related negative impacts on our environment.
- Micro-/nano plastic removal, towards a zero-brine discharge.
- Decentralised, circular production of fuels, chemicals and materials where waste
serves as an indispensable local resource enabling on -site production replacing
fossil resources. Reduction in the demand for fossil fuels alongside associated CO2
and pollutant emissions reductions.

III. EIC Transition
Have you identified EU-funded project result (s) with promising commercial potential
that could be the basis for ground -breaking innovations and promising new
businesses?
 Is this novel promising technology ready for the next steps towards its
maturation and validation , to be further developed and validated for  some
specific, high potential, commercial applications?
 Have you conducted a preliminary market research to identify potential markets
for your innovation and explored potential competitors?
 Do you envisage building a motivated and entrepreneurial team with a mix of
skills, including researchers, business people, marketers etc. to develop and
drive the idea towards commercial success?
If the answer to each and every of these questions is a clear ‘yes’, then EIC Transition
may be the right call for you.
Why should you apply?
EIC Transition funds innovation activities that go beyond the experimental proof of
principle in laboratory (applications must have completed all elements of Technology
Readiness Level 3 ). It supports both the maturation and validation of your novel
technology from the lab to the relevant application environments (by making use of
prototyping, formulation, models, user testing or other validation tests) as well as
explorations and development of a sustainable business plan and business model
towards commercialisation into high potential markets.
Your proposed activities must include further technology development on the results
achieved in a previous project and follow user -centric methodologies to increase
chances of the innovation’s future commercial success in the market. EIC Transition
projects should address, in a balanced way, both technology and market/business
development, possibly including iterative learning processes based on early customer
or user feedback. These activities should include, subject to the level of maturity of the
technology, a suitable mix of technology development and validation activities to
increase the maturity of the technology beyond proof of concept to viable
demonstrators of the technology in the intended field of application (i.e., applications
must have completed all elements of Technology Readiness Level 3 up to TRL 5 to 6 at
the end of the project ). The activities must in all cases address  improving market
readiness towards commercialisation and deployment (market research, value
52

proposition, refine incipient business plan79 and validate incipient business model80,
intellectual property protection, etc.) and aspects of regulation, certification and
standardisation (if relevant), aimed at getting both the technology and the business
idea investment ready.
EIC Transition aims at maturing both your technology and business idea thus increasing
its technology and market/commercial readiness. The expected outcomes of your EIC
Transition project are a) a technology that is demonstrated to be effective for its
intended application and b) a validated business model and a business plan 81 for its
development to market. It is also expected that the intellectual property generated by
your EIC Transition project is formally protected in an adequate way (Annex 6).
EIC Transition can support several different pathways beyond fundamental research,
from technology development and product design to business modelling and
commercialisation strategy to reach the market. Some non -exhaustive illustrative
examples could be the following pathways:
 A focused collaborative project to further develop strategic and high impact
technologies towards specific applications while improving also the market
readiness towards a promising market application. This pathway is likely to
require a collaboration among several applicants (‘multi -beneficiary’ approach)
including SMEs, research performers, technology transfer offices and poten tial
users/ customers;
 An individual SME (including start-ups, spin-offs) identifies a market opportunity
to apply the results of an eligible project towards a specific market application.
This pathway is likely to require, or lead to, a licensing arrangement with the
SME and could also involve a collaboration between the result owner(s) of the
eligible project and the interested SME;
 A team of entrepreneurial researchers within a research or technology
organisation who want to turn selected project results into a viable product by
looking for a suitable business model or creating a start-up or spin-off company,
and which may involve co llaboration with the host research or technology
organisation, as well as their technology transfer offices. In some cases, the
results may already be relatively close to market or ready for investment (e.g.
often with higher TRLs) and would therefore norm ally not need significant
further technological development and hence require lower amounts of funding.

79 Usual components are products or services provided, market analysis, competition analysis, marketing strategy,
organisation & management, financial projections.
80 It usually includes value proposition, target market(s), revenue streams, cost structure, channels.
81 Business model is a key component of the business plan.
53

Technology Transfer Offices or business schools are encouraged to actively participate
in the EIC Transition project, as they can play a key role in enabling and supporting
researchers with the development and commercialisation of their research results.
At the end of your EIC Transition project, you should be ready for the next stage, which
can be to apply for EIC Accelerator (if you are a SME, including start -ups or spin-offs),
and to seek other investors or sources of funding, to enter licensing or collaboration
agreements with third parties, or other routes to market deployment. In case your
project is not led by an SME or commercial partner, the formation and spin out of a
new company can be included as part of the activities. You will be expected to describe
the intended pathway and route to market in your proposal and must include specific
milestones together with concrete and verifiable KPIs during the implementation of
your project to assess progress towards the market.
The EIC Transition project is expected to mature your innovation both in its TRL and
market and business readiness82 from the beginning of the project and with both tracks
going in parallel and interacting between them.
Applicants to EIC Transition can submit proposals through an EIC Transition Open call
which has no predefined thematic priorities and is open to proposals in any field of
science, technology or application.83
Can you apply?
In order to  apply, your proposal must meet the general eligibility requirements (see
Annex 2) as well as specific eligibility requirements described in this section.
Your proposal must build on results already achieved within an eligible project that are,
at least, at experimental proof of concept ( applications must have completed all
elements of Technology Readiness Level 3 or, ideally, technology validated in the lab

Applications with elements that  concern the evolution of European communication
networks (5G, post -5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European
communication networks) will be subject to restriction for the protection of European
communication networks (see Annex II – Section B1)
What support will you receive if your proposal is funded?
The total indicative budget for this call is EUR 98 million.
If successful, you will receive a grant for a Research and Innovation Action to cover the
eligible costs, necessary for the implementation of your project. For this call, the EIC
considers proposals with a requested EU contribution of more than EUR 0.5 million and
less than EUR 2.5 million and duration between 1 and 3 years as appropriate.
Nonetheless, in exceptional cases, this does not preclude you to request larger
amounts, if very well motivated and duly explained.
The funding rate of this grant will be 100% of the eligible costs. Eligible costs will take
the form of a lump sum and the amount will be determined during the evaluation
process. Applicants must therefore propose the amount of the lump sum based on
their estimated project costs as defined in the Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the
use of lump sum contributions under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework
Programme for Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2021-
2025).91
The projects funded through EIC Transition are eligible:
 to receive Booster grants of a fixed amount not exceeding EUR 50 000 to
undertake complementary activities to explore potential pathways to
commercialisation or for portfolio activities (see Annex 5).
 to submit an EIC Accelerator proposal via the Fast Track scheme (see Annex 3).
In addition to funding, projects will receive tailor-made access to a wide range of
Business Acceleration Services and matchmaking events (see Section V).
The Model Grant Agreement can be found on the Funding & Tenders portal.

91 This decision is available on the  EU Funding & Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon
Europe, under ‘Simplified costs decisions’ or through this link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-
tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls-decision_he_en.pdf
57

How do you apply; how long does it take?
The deadline for submitting your proposal is 17 September 2025  at 17h00 Brussels
local time.92
You must submit your proposal via the Funding & Tenders Portal before the given
deadline.
Sections 1 to 3 and the cover page (that includes the information about the related
project on which the current EIC Transition proposal is built on) of part B of your
proposal must consist of a maximum of 22 format A4 pages.
Your proposal will be evaluated first by EIC expert evaluators. You will be informed
about the result of this evaluation, including feedback on your proposal, indicatively
within 9 weeks after the call deadline. If your proposal successfully passes this first
evaluation phase (see details below), you will be invited for an interview, which will be
organised approximately between 11-13 weeks after the deadline. At the interview, you
will be assessed by a panel of maximum 6 EIC Jury members. You will be infor med
about the result of the interview indicatively within 4 weeks from the start of the
interviews.
If you are successful, you can expect your grant agreement to be signed within 6
months from the call deadline (indicative) and you are expected to start your project
within 2 months after signing the grant agreement.
How does the EIC decide if your proposal will be funded?
In a first step, at least three EIC expert evaluators will evaluate and score your proposal
against each award criterion (see below). The overall score for each evaluation criterion
will be the average of the corresponding scores attributed by the individual evaluators.
The total score of your proposal will be the sum of the overall scores from the three
evaluation criteria.
Starting with the highest scoring proposal and in descending order, a pool of the best
ranked proposals (highest scoring) requesting an aggregated financial support equal
to approximately 2.2 times the budget available, will be invited to the next step.  If in
that pool:
 at least 30% of the applications are submitted by women-led SMEs or consortia
(see definitions in the Glossary), only the applications of that pool will be invited
to interviews;

92 The call will open on 22-April-2025. The Director-General responsible for the call may decide to open the call up
to one month prior to or after the envisaged  date(s) of opening. The Director -General responsible may delay the
deadline(s) by up to two months.
58

 less than 30% of the applications are submitted by women -led SMEs or
consortia,93 the pool will be expanded to subsequent best ranked applications
(starting with the highest scoring in descending, sequential order and at least
equal score under Excellence criterion) submitted by women -led SMEs or
consortia until reaching, if possible, a composition of the pool of at least 30% of
applications submitted by women -led SMEs or consortia. All such applicants
invited to interview must have met all evaluation criteria thresholds from the
remote evaluation (Table 4).
The Agency will seek assistance from the European Patent Office to analyse the
technological novelty, the inventive merit and the proposed future strategy of EIC
proposals shortlisted for EIC Jury interview. EPO experts will not participate directly in
the evaluation process but will provide their assessment to the EIC Jury as material ‘for
information’. The assessment by the patent examiners will not be binding and the Jury
appointed by the EIC will have complete freedom to decide on its relevance.
The second step is an interview with an EIC jury. At the interview your proposal may be
represented by a maximum of five persons. 94 Only individuals mentioned in the
proposal and involved in the future project implementation can represent your
proposal at the interview.
The EIC Jury will be composed of between four and six members and may additionally
include one  EIC Programme Manager  as observer  with expertise  in your area or
managing one of the EIC Portfolios your project could be allocated to. During the
interview you should convincingly pitch your proposal to the EIC Jury, who will ask you
questions aimed at clarifying various aspects of your proposal in line with the award
criteria (in particular those regarding the quality of the team, the different elements
already developed within the incipient business plan and incipient business model, the
milestones and KPIs). The EIC Jury will recommend your proposal for funding , place it
on a reserve list or not (‘GO’, ‘GO Reserve’ ‘NO GO’). If the jury recommends a proposal
to be placed in a reserve list  (‘GO Reserve’)  the proposal may then be funded if
additional budget becomes available. The remote evaluation score will be used to rank
the proposals in the reserve list95.
Proposers who succeed in securing EIC Transition funding will be strongly encouraged
to undertake in the project’s first year, the “Investor Readiness training” ( including

93 The definition of women-led SMEs and consortia is provided in the Glossary in the Introduction.
94 The number of participants to the interview must however be limited to the minimum necessary.

IV. EIC Accelerator
 Do you have a high-impact innovative technology, product, service or business
model that could create new markets or disrupt existing ones in Europe and
even worldwide?
 Are you a  start-up or a small and medium -sized enterprise (SME) with the
ambition and commitment to scale up?
 Are you looking for substantial funding , but the risks involved are too high for
private investors alone to invest the full amount needed?
If your answers to the above questions are ‘yes’, then the EIC Accelerator may be the
right funding scheme for you.
Why should you apply?
The EIC Accelerator supports companies (principally SMEs, including start-ups) to scale
up high impact innovations with the potential to create new markets or disrupt existing
ones. The EIC Accelerator provides a unique combination of grant and investment
funding and Business Acceleration Services (see Section V).
The EIC Accelerator focuses in particular on innovations building on scientific discovery
or technological breakthroughs (‘deep tech’) and where significant funding is needed
over a long timeframe before returns can be generated (‘patient capital’). Such
innovations often struggle to attract financing because the risks and time period
involved are too high. Funding and support from the EIC Accelerator is designed to
enable such innovators to attract the full investment amounts needed for scale up in a
shorter timeframe.
The EIC Accelerator supports the later stages of technology development as well as
scale up. The technology component of your innovation must therefore have been
tested and validated in a laboratory and other relevant environment ( e.g., at least
Technology Readiness Level 5). The EIC Accelerator looks to support companies where
the EIC support will act as a catalyst to crowd in other investors necessary for the scale
up of the innovation.
Applicants to EIC Accelerator can submit proposals through:
 EIC Accelerator Open, which has no predefined thematic priorities and is open
to proposals in any field of technology or application97;

97 In line with the Do Not Significant Harm principle, see Introduction. Proposals with potential nuclear applications
including those within the scope of Annex I to the Euratom Treaty are eligible for funding.
63

 EIC Accelerator Challenges in predefined areas of emerging and strategic
technologies.
Can you apply?
To be an eligible applicant to EIC Accelerator, you must apply as one of the following
eligible entities:
 a single company classified as a SME, and established within a Member State or
an Associated Country (see Annex 2); or
 a single company classified as a small mid -cap (up to 499 employees)
established in a Member State or an Associated Country, but only for
“investment component only” support or for “blended finance” in  exceptional
cases for rapid scale up purposes; or
 one or more natural persons 98 (including individual entrepreneurs) or legal
entities, which are either:
a. from a Member State or an Associated Country intending to establish an SME
or small mid-cap (as defined above) in a Member State or Associated Country
by the time of signing the EIC Accelerator grant agreement or, in case the
equity only is awarded, at the latest at the date of signature of the investment
agreement;
b. intending to invest in an SME or small mid-cap established in a Member State
or an Associated Country and may submit a proposal on behalf of that SME
or small mid-cap, provided that a prior agreement exists with the company.
The grant agreement and/or the investment agreement will be signed with
the beneficiary/ final recipient of funding company only , subject to the
"Approach in specific cases relating to a parent or holding company and an
operating company" (see below); or
c. from a non-associated third country intending to establish an SME (including
start-ups) or to relocate an existing SME to a Member State or an Associated
Country. The company must prove its effective establishment in a Member
State or an Associated Country at the time of submission of the full proposal.
The standard admissibility and eligibility conditions are detailed in Annex 2.
There are limitations on the number of times you can submit a proposal described in
the section on application submission limits as explained below.

98 In such cases, the applicant must use the same identification (PIC number) when submitting the full application
in order to eligible.
64

If you are currently a participant in an eligible project funded by Horizon Europe or
Horizon 2020 then you may be able to apply through your existing project under the
Fast Track scheme (see Annex 3). This scheme is managed by the funding body
responsible for the existing project and applies to funding bodies listed in Annex 3.
Applicants may also be able to apply if they have a project financed by an eligible
programme managed by a Member State or an Associated Country under the pilot
Plug-in scheme (see Annex 4).
What support will you receive if your proposal is funded?
The total indicative budget for this call is EUR 634 million. EUR 384 million of the total
indicative budget will be allocated to EIC Accelerator Open and EUR 250 million to EIC
Accelerator Challenges. The total indicative budget for each Accelerator Challenges is
provided in Challenge descriptions below.
The indicative budget for investment components is EUR 348 million and is managed
by the EIC Fund. This budget may be increased by unused amounts allocated to the
EIC Fund under previous EIC Work Programmes99.
The EIC Accelerator provides:
a) grant component only  (‘Grant Only’) that will take the form of a lump sum
contribution100 via a grant agreement. Grant only shall be provided only once to
any legal entity for the duration of the Horizon Europe programme (2021 -27)
and under the following cumulative conditions:
 the project shall include information on the capacities and willingness of the
applicant to scale-up;
 the beneficiary shall be a start-up or an SME;
 a grant-only support under the Accelerator shall be provided only once to a
beneficiary during the period of implementation of the Programme for a
maximum of EUR 2.5 million.

b) blended finance support which is composed of:
 An investment component usually in the form of direct equity or quasi -
equity such as convertible loans via an investment agreement.

99 See Annex 1 for full information about the budget.
100 Decision authorising the use of lump sum contributions under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework
Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027) – and in actions under the Research and Training Programme
of the European Atomic Energy Community (2021-2025)
65

 A grant component, that will take the form of a lump sum contribution 101
via a grant agreement.
c) investment component only (Equity -Only) usually in the form of direct equity
or quasi-equity such as convertible loans via an investment agreement
All successful proposals will receive, in addition to funding, tailor -made access to a
wide range of Business Acceleration Services (see Section V).
The 30% co-funding of the work packages to be covered by the grant component has
to be financed by the beneficiary through its own resources.
The EIC Accelerator model grant agreement can be found on the Funding & Tenders
Portal102.
EIC Accelerator investment component (for blended finance and equity only
proposals)
The minimum investment component is EUR 0.5 million  and the maximum is EUR 1 0
million103. Higher amounts are available under the EIC STEP Scale-up call.
The investment component is intended to finance market deployment and scale up
and it can be requested in parallel to the grant (and may be used for co -financing
innovation activities) or at a later stage during the lifetime of their grant agreement .
Within the maximum budget awarded by the Commission, the terms of investment will
be negotiated on a case-by-case basis104 in accordance with the EIC Fund Investment
Guidelines105.
The investment component of the EIC is designed to fill the funding gap for high -risk
innovations to a stage where they can be fully co-financed or financed under the
InvestEU programme or by private investors alone. As the EIC Accelerator is designed
to bear the risk of potential breakthrough market creating innovations in order to
attract private investors in a second stage, the lack of such investors at the initial stage
does not prevent the EIC investment to be agreed.

Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027) – and in actions under the Research and Training Programme
of the European Atomic Energy Community (2021-2025)
102 Funding & tenders (europa.eu)
103 In certain cases, investments can be made in holding structures of the beneficiary company, subject to the
provisions of the EIC Fund Investment Guidelines
104 In the case of the investment component, the financial support may exceptionally be revised following a periodic
or final review of an EIC Accelerator project (in line with Article 48(12), second sub paragraph of the Horizon Europe
Regulation), also in light of the terms and conditions established in the investment agreement. The EIC Investment
Guidelines are available on the EIC website.

When implementing investments, the EIC Fund will ensure that supported companies
keep most of their value, including their IP, in the EU or in the Associated Countries in
order to contribute to their economic growth and job creatio n. Where necessary to
protect European interests in strategic areas,  the EIC Fund will be requested to take
appropriate safeguard measures for individual companies on a case -by-case basis in
order to protect European interests as defined in the Investment Guidelines (see
Introduction, section on economic Security).
EIC Accelerator grant component (for blended finance and grant-only proposals)
Eligible costs for the grant component are reimbursed up to a maximum of 70% within
the ceiling of the maximum grant amount, i.e. EUR 2 499 999), but for blended finance
the grant component  may be for a higher amount in exceptional and well justified
cases.
EIC Accelerator grant funding covers innovation activities, including demonstration of
the technology in the relevant environment, prototyping and system level
demonstration, R&D and testing required to meet regulatory and standardisation
requirements, intellectual property management, and marketing approval (e.g. at least
TRL 6106 to 8).
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum and the amount will be determined
during the evaluation process. Applicants must therefore propose the amount of the
lump sum based on their estimated project costs as defined in the Decision of 7 July
2021 a uthorising the use of lump sum contributions under the Horizon Europe
Programme – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) –
and in actions under the Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic
Energy Community (2021-2025).107
The innovation activities to be supported should normally be completed within 24
months but may be longer in well justified cases. The proposed duration should
genuinely reflect your current TRL and the nature of the technology to be developed
and demonstrated. The grant component may be used for subcontracting including,
only if justified, for activities which are essential for the objectives of the project. The
Agency may object to a transfer of ownership or the licensing of results under certain
conditions in accordance with the provisions set out in the grant agreement.

106 To be interpreted as all applicants has completed all aspects of TRL 5: validation in relevant environment.
107 This decision is available on the Funding & Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon
Europe, under ‘Simplified costs decisions’ or through this link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-
tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls-decision_he_en.pdf

68

evaluation elements (set out in the next section) and can therefore proceed to submit
a full proposal. In both cases, you will receive feedback from four expert evaluators.
2. Submission of full proposals
If your short proposal is successful, you will be entitled to receive coaching support to
prepare a full proposal  from one of the business coaches from the Business
Acceleration Services.110 You can only receive this support once for a proposal.
The optional coaching support is designed to improve the value proposition, business
plan and investor pitch . However, it is your decision how to respond to the feedback
and support, and the content of your proposal is your sole responsibility.
If you succeeded with your short application under the 202 5 Work programme, your
full proposal can be submitted to any of the following cut-offs during 2025, and any of
the cut -offs for 202 6. Applicants who succeeded with a positive evaluation of their
short proposal under the 2023 or 2024 EIC Work Programme may apply to any of the
following cut-offs in 2025. You may decide which cut-off to apply to.
The two cut-off dates for 2025 are:111
 March 12
 October 1
The cut-off dates for 2026 will be announced in the 2026 Work Programme due to be
adopted in Autumn 2025.
The full proposal consists of:
 a full business plan and full information on the company’s finances and structure
of the potential beneficiary/final recipient company. You will also need to
propose a set of milestones to be used as a basis for the EIC to manage the
funding for your innovation.
 a pitch-deck in pdf format112 and a video pitch of up to three minutes. You may
decide to reuse or update the pitch -deck and video pitch submitted with your
short proposal.

110 It is nevertheless up to the applicants to decide if and when to use the coaching services.
111 This call is continuously open, and applications can be submitted at any time. From the day of the opening of
the call the conditions detailed in this work programme become applicable. The Director -General responsible may
delay the cut-off(s) by up to two months. Applicants will be invited to select an EIC business coach out of a dedicated
database and may receive 3 days of remote coaching.
112 There are no limits on the number of slides at full application stage, but the applicant must be able to present at
the Jury interview in a maximum of 10 minutes.
69

All personal data and information in your proposal will be kept strictly confidential.
However, before submitting your full proposal, you will need to give consent to share
necessary information with the EIC Fund, if applying for investment.
Likewise, applicants requesting an investment component will be requested to give
their consent to the Agency through Business Acceleration Services and the EIC Fund
to support the search for suitable investment partners and share the necessary
information, including personal and proposal data, with these investment partners.
Once you submit your full proposal, it will be assessed remotely against award criteria
evaluation elements (set out in the next section) by three EIC expert evaluators. Within
approximately eight to nine weeks113 you will be informed about the result of the
remote evaluation and will receive feedback. If successful, you will be invited to attend
an interview (which may be in person or online) with an EIC Jury.
3. Interview with an EIC Jury.
All companies receiving a GO from the remote evaluation stage will be invited to the
interviews. In case the number of applicants to invite exceeds the capacities of the
initially planned interview sessions, a first batch of applicants will be invited according
to the following prioritisation, starting with category ‘a’ (see below), proceeding to the
next:
a. Gender balance: women-led companies ( until 40% of invited companies is
reached);
b. Submission date and time: any remaining companies will be prioritised based
on the date and time of submission of their short proposal.
The remaining batch of applicants to the interview will be invited to a later set of jury
interviews to be organised before the interviews of the next cut-off date.
Interviews with EIC Juries will be organised approximately four to five weeks after
applicants are informed of the result of the remote evaluation (or longer if there is a
need for a further set of interviews). Detailed information about the format of the
interview will be communicated to you in the invitation. You will be informed about the
result of the interview within approximately two to three weeks after the finalisation of
the interviews.
The Agency may reimburse the cost of applicants invited to attend on -site interviews
during the evaluation of their proposals . This information will be communicated to
applicants when invited to the interview.

113 This period includes the consensus meetings.
70

The Agency aims to complete the full process from submission of the full application
(cut-off date for full proposal submission) to signature of the grant agreement within
7 months in most cases.
4. Invitation to negotiate grant component and due diligence process  for
investment component
If you are selected for funding, the next steps are as follows depending on the type of
support.
Grant Only : you will be invited to prepare the grant agreement. Once the grant
agreement preparations are concluded, and subject to the adoption of the award
decision, you will be invited to sign the EIC Accelerator grant agreement. You will then
receive, a first pre-financing payment on the grant component. The Agency will provide
the initial pre-financing in accordance with the relevant provisions of the grant
agreement.
Blended finance: A single award decision will be adopted by the Commission covering
both grant and investment components.  The maximum amount for the investment
component set in the Single Award Decision will follow the amount requested by the
applicant, with an additional flexibility amount of maximum EUR 2 million per proposal.
The flexibility amount is to enable the EIC Fund to make an investment decision for a
higher amount than requested if ju stified to take account of developments of the
company since the date of application and the opportunity of catalysing a larger overall
funding round with co-investors. The additional flexibility amount may only be used if
there are sufficient amounts avai lable on the EIC Fund accounts (e.g.  due to unused
budget from other investments) and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
Following the award decision and completion of the grant agreement preparations,
you will be invited to sign a grant agreement.
The relevant information from your proposal will be transmitted to the EIC Fund and
its investment advisor (the European Investment Bank) , to structure the potential
investment agreement (compliance checks, 114 due diligence, syndication of potential
co-investors, tranches of investment and related objectives and milestones, etc.). The
EIB will assess with you the relevant timing and urgency of your needs for the
investment component which may be immediate, or at a later stage in the grant
implementation, or in a number of tranches.

114 Such as KYC (Know Your Customer), AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism),
Tax compliance, Sanctions, etc.
71

During this stage and, in particular, if you have not yet secured other investors, the EIC
Fund or the Business Acceleration Services provided by the Agency will support you in
the search for other investors. You will be asked for your consent before other investors
are contacted or engaged in negotiations related to your proposal and company.
At the end of this process, which should usually take approximately between two to six
months since the selection for funding, an investment component  will be decided by
the EIC Fund.  The decision to invest as well as the amount and the terms of the
investment component will be made by the EIC Fund in compliance with the EIC
Investment Guidelines. 115 The investment amount decided by the EIC Fund will be
within the maximum set by the Single Award Decision , as  well as within the total
amount available to the EIC Fund for investments. In some cases, the investment
decision may lead to amendments to the grant agreement, for example in order to
align the timing and definitions of milestones.  Lack of progress in the negotiations of
the investment component by the beneficiary (and, in particular, insufficient proactive
efforts from the beneficiary to attract potential co-investors to invest alongside the EIC
Fund) may trigger a suspension of the payment  deadlines as per Article 29.1(c) of the
Model Grant Agreement.
Should the outcome of the due diligence conclude that the innovation or your
company is not yet mature for investment, the EIC Fund may recommend to the
Commission that you start with the grant component first, and that the investment
component will be subject to reaching defined milestones.  In such cases, the EIC Fund
will re-examine the due diligence once the defined milestone has been achieved and
may then proceed to taking an investment decision. The investment decision must be
taken during the grant a greement or within one year after the end of the duration of
the grant. If no investment decision is taken during this period, you may subsequently
apply for equity-only support.
As an outcome of the due diligence process, the investment may be rejected, notably
due to the results of the due diligence, compliance checks, existence of irregularities,
in cases of misrepresentation by the applicant or in the case of a manifest error in any
previous assessments, in accordance with the EIC Investment guidelines. In such a case,
the Agency may also request amendments to the grant agreement. In cases of
misrepresentation, submission of false information, non -submission of information,
suspicion of fraud or any other ground listed in the EIC Accelerator grant agreement,
the Agency may suspend and/or terminate your grant agreement. The EIC Accelerator

115 The investment decisions will also be reported to the Programme Committee in accordance with Article 14 of
Council Decision (EU) 2021/764.
72

grant agreement may also be terminated if the non -investment is likely to affect the
implementation of the action or puts into question the decision awarding the financial
support.
How does the EIC decide if your proposal will be funded?
The EIC Accelerator is highly selective and only the very best proposals can be funded.
Your proposal will be assessed on its merits by leading experts and the Commission
will ensure open and fair competition to all eligible proposals submitted.
1. Evaluation of short proposals
Short proposals will be evaluated by four EIC expert evaluators. These four evaluators’
competences will match the area of technology and market application of your
innovation. The EIC expert evaluators will look at the innovativeness/disruptiveness of
your idea, its impact and your team using the evaluation criteria specified below.
Each evaluator will assess whether your short proposal meets each of the evaluation
elements (Table 6) and give a GO or NO GO:
 If at least three out of the four evaluators give a GO, then your short proposal will
be successful, and you will be invited to prepare a full proposal.
 If at least two out of the four evaluators give a NO GO, then your proposal is
considered unsuccessful and will be rejected . You may resubmit your proposal,
according to applicant submission limits (see below section 3).  You will be
expected to make improvements to your proposal.

Table 6. Evaluation elements for EIC Accelerator Open and Challenges at short
proposal stage
Excellence
Novelty and breakthrough nature of the innovation:  Is the proposed innovation  highly
novel, deep tech breakthrough compared to existing solutions?
Technology readiness level:  Is there sufficient demonstration that  the innovation has
completed all aspects of TRL 5 (validation in a relevant environment for the application of the
technology) and therefore the innovation is currently at TRL 6?
Timing: Is the innovation at the cutting edge of new market, societal or technological trends?
Impact
73

Competitiveness and demand: Is the innovation better than what the competition proposes,
and is the solution bringing sufficient added value to trigger demand from potential
customers?
Market development: Does the innovation have the potential to develop new markets or
significantly transform existing ones?
Broader impact: Will the innovation, if successfully commercialised achieve positive societal,
economic, environmental116 or climate impacts?
Level of risk, implementation and need for Union support
Team: Does the team have the capability and motivation to implement the innovation
proposal and bring it to the market? Is there a plan to acquire any critical competencies which
are currently missing, including adequate gender balance?

2. Evaluation of full proposals: remote evaluation and interviews
Full proposals will be assessed following the cut -off dates listed above. This will start
with a remote evaluation where your full proposal will be sent to three EIC expert
evaluators (different than the short proposal evaluators) who se expertise  will be
matched against the area of technology and application of your innovation. The expert
evaluators will then assess your proposal against the award criteria and their evaluation
elements set out below.
Each evaluator will assess whether your full proposal meets each of the elements of the
award criteria and give a GO or NO GO per element:
 If all three evaluators give a GO for all the evaluation elements, then your full
proposal will be successful , and you will be invited to an interview with an EIC
jury.
 if two of the three evaluators give a GO for all the evaluation elements, then
there will be a consensus meeting to decide if you will be invited to an interview
with an EIC Jury.   For proposals submitted to either the Open or Challenge
topics, all three experts must give a GO during the consensus meeting for the
proposal to be invited to interview.
 If two or more of the evaluators give a NO GO on any of the evaluation elements,
then your proposal will be rejected.
The EIC jury will have access to the remote evaluation results of your full proposal but
will not have access to your short proposal or the evaluation results of your short

116 Projects must comply with the ‘do no significant harm’ principle enshrined in Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy
Regulation as part of the eligibility criteria.
74

proposal and will also not have access to any previous proposals in cases of
resubmissions.
EIC Jury members, based on your interview and their overall assessment, will
recommend your proposal for funding (GO) or not (NO GO):
 If the proposal receives a GO and is recommended for funding, the EIC Jury may
recommend providing a lower grant amount  than the one requested by the
applicant. For the investment component, t he EIC jury will not recommend an
amount different than the one requested by the applicant  but may make
observations for consideration by the EIC Fund. The EIC jury will not change the
form of support (blended, grant only  equity only) but may make
recommendations to be taken into account when negotiating the grant or
investment component, including for example on the milestones and the
valuation, and on proposed coaching activities.
 If your proposal receives a NO GO and is not recommended for funding, your
proposal will be awarded a Seal of Excellence 117 to facilitate funding from
alternative funding sources and access to Business Acceleration Services.
Exceptionally, EIC juries may recommend that your proposal does not receive a
Seal of Excellence if they find weaknesses in your proposal which were not
identified by the expert evaluators at the remote evaluation stage  and which
mean the proposal does not meet all of the evaluation criteria . In such cases,
you will receive feedback to justify this recommendation.
 If your proposal is submitted under one of the STEP-relevant Challenges calls,
your project will  be awarded the Sovereignty  (STEP) Seal118, in both cases (i.e.
for both GO and NO-GO recommendations). Exceptionally, EIC juries may
recommend that your proposal does not receive a Sovereignty (STEP) Seal if
they find weaknesses in your proposal which were not identified by the expert
evaluators at the remote evaluation stage  and which mean the proposal does
not meet all of the evaluation criteria. In such cases, you will receive feedback to
justify this recommendation.
Following the notification of the outcome of your application, you will receive an official
rejection letter (and your Seal of Excellence  and Sovereignty (STEP) Seal , if awarded).
Seals of Excellence and Sovereignty (STEP) Seals may be funded by national or

117 In accordance to Article 48(7) of the Horizon Europe regulation. To make Seal of Excellence operational applicants
must give the consent to share basic data about their application with other alternative funding and support bodies.
118 As STEP Seal beneficiary, you might be requested to provide additional documentation for the purpose of an
Ownership and Control Assessment where there is such requirement.

European programmes for both grant and investment components and may also be
supported for only the grant component (even if selected for blended finance).
Member States may decide to transfer budget from ERDF  Programmes to Horizon
Europe to support EIC Seals of Excellence. In this case the Seals will be directly funded
by the Agency for the grant component and the EIC Fund for the investment
component; in case the transfer is restricted by the relevant Member State to grant
funding only, then applicants will receive “grant only” support even if they were
evaluated for blended finance.
Indicatively, the budget for grant components will be allocated approximately equally
between the cut -offs. In case the amount allocated to GO applicants is less than the
budget available for that cut -off, or additional budget becomes available, then the
remaining available budget will be allocated to  the subsequent cut -off. In case the
amount allocated to GO applicants is above the budget available, then a number of
applicants corresponding to the unavailable budget will be awarded funding using the
available budget of the subsequent cut-off. Such applicants will be identified using the
ordering set out above for the invitation to interviews.
Full proposals will be assessed according to the following award criteria (Table 7). The
EIC Jury may focus the interview on any element of your proposal based on the remote
evaluation result and its own assessment.

Application submission limits
The EIC Accelerator applies limitations on the number of unsuccessful submissions of
the same/improved proposal by the same legal entity. These limitations apply equally
to applicants submitted via the Fast Track or Plug In schemes.
After three unsuccessful submissions119 of the same/improved proposal by the same
legal entity to the EIC Accelerator  call for Challenges or Open , which can be at any
stage of the process (Short Proposal, Full Proposal) and for any form of support (Grant
only, Blended finance), an applicant may not apply again to the EIC Accelerator under
the Horizon Europe Framework Programme.
In all cases, applicants are expected to take into account the feedback on their previous
submission and only reapply if they have made significant improvements.
Approach for follow-on investments by the EIC Fund
The EIC Fund may provide follow on investments in companies that have already been
selected and awarded equity support. Such follow-on investments consist of amounts
additional to the original maximum amount laid down in the Award Decision or the
decision on investment, within a maximum of EUR 1 0 million120 and subject to
availability of budget. Such follow -on investments will be subject to a project review
by external experts (to ensure the evaluation criteria for Accelerator are met) , and an
amended Award Decision by the European Commission , as well as a renewed
assessment (due diligence) by the EIB as investment adviser to the EIC Fund.121

119 Submissions as from 1 January 2024
120 Higher amounts for follow on investments are available by applying under the EIC STEP Scale-up call.
121 In accordance with Article 48(12), second subparagraph, of the Horizon Europe Regulation. The Programme
Committee shall be informed of such cases.
78

Such follow-on investments will be limited to the following exceptional categories of
cases122:
i) Where necessary to secure EU interests which cannot be otherwise protected or
in the case of strategic technologies123, or
ii) If subsequent funding rounds would not proceed or would proceed at
significantly less favourable terms without the EIC Fund’s follow-on investment.
The EIC Fund may also provide investments to companies that received “Grant first”
support under the EIC Work Programmes  2021 to 2023 , subject to these companies
achieving the milestones set for proceeding with the investment component.
The budget for follow on investments and the investment component subsequent to
“Grant first” support will come with priority from the follow -on reserve budget as
indicated in Annex 1 or from returns generated by EIC Fund investments. In case these
budgets are exhausted, available amounts from the budget of this call or from previous
amounts allocated to the EIC Fund may be used. In case the budget reserved for follow
on investments is not fully used for the above cases, the remaining amount will be
transferred to the Accelerator Open call.
Approach in specific cases relating to a parent or holding company and an
operating company124
In some cases of EIC Accelerator it may be necessary for the EIC Fund to invest in the
parent or holding company and not in the company that applied for EIC Accelerator
support and is the beneficiary of the grant component. This includes cases where the
parent or holding company is where all other investors have invested and will invest in
the future and where any potential upside will take place.
Applicants should already indicate in their application if they have a parent or holding
company for the purposes of the investment component. In such cases t he EIC Fund
may decide to invest not in the beneficiary but in its parent or holding company if the
following conditions are fulfilled:
- the parent or holding company fulfils all relevant criteria, including SME status,
non-bankability for the purpose of the EIC Accelerator, and establishment in an
EU Member State or Associated County, and
- the EIC Fund Investment Guidelines are followed.

122 These cases stem from the advice of the EIC Board.
123 Investments will be consider ed strategic where without securing the investment in the Union there is a risk of
dependency of a critical technology on a limited number of third country suppliers. This assessment will be made
as part of the amending Commission Award Decision. See also section on economic security of the introduction.
124 In case of equity only, the parent or holding company will have to submit the application.
79

In these cases, and where there is a grant component of support, the grant agreement
with the beneficiary will include the parent or holding company as an affiliated entity
in its role as investee.125
Indirect management of the investment component of the EIC Accelerator
In line with Article 11(3) of Council Decision 2021/764/EU establishing the Specific
Programme implementing Horizon Europe, the Commission has entrusted tasks
related to the implementation and management of the investment component of the
EIC Accelerator to the European Investment Bank as the implementing partner for an
indicative budget for investment amounts as shown in Annex 1.


125 Where necessary, via an amendment to the grant agreement.

IV.2.1 Acceleration of advanced materials development and upscaling
along the value chain
Background and scope
Advanced Materials are defined as materials that are engineered with a view to
enhancing functional performance above and beyond that of existing materials128. They
are key enablers for the development of game -changing products and innovative
solutions in many industrial sectors, such as energy, mobility, electronics, and
construction.
As stated in the European Commission Communication “Advanced Materials for
Industrial Leadership”129, there is an urgent need to boost all the stages of development
of advanced materials, such as their design, scale-up and manufacturing capacity (from
lab to fab), as demand for these materials is expected to increase significantly in the
coming years.
This requires investment to identify and bring breakthrough innovations to the market
that cover the full value chain from developers and producers of advanced materials
alongside those companies developing digital tools for designing , synthesising,
modelling and characterising advanced materials including those supported by
Artificial Intelligence / machine learning.
This Challenge therefore aims at scaling SMEs belonging to the whole value chain of
advanced materials and addressing one or more of these four key application  areas:
energy, mobility, electronics, construction. It contribute s to a common European
approach in accelerating the scaling up of advanced materials, a critical technology
identified under the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)130, and thereby
addresses the risks to the EU’s future strategic autonomy in this area.
Specific objectives
Companies supported under this Challenge should target one or both of the following
areas, taking into account the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework, including Life
Cycle Assessment and circularity approaches:
• Technologies for design, synthesis, characterisation, up-scaling, and production
of advanced materials.
• Scaling up processes to reach the targeted functionalities or improved
performance of advanced materials, such as surface functionalization of
nanoparticles, or additive manufacturing approaches which may enable a fast
integration of the advanced materials into smart devices.

129 Advanced Materials for Industrial Leadership - European Commission (europa.eu)
130 Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform - European Union (europa.eu)
83

The advanced materials and associated processes in the above  mentioned four key
application areas must be developed minimizing the use of resources, in particular
critical raw materials (CRMs), and the environmental footprint. The latter is to be
measured with a life -cycle analysis that includes an evaluation of the  cost and social
impact.
Expected outcomes and impacts:
In support of the Commission Communication on Advanced Ma terials for Industrial
Leadership131, the European Green Deal industrial plan 132, the New European
Innovation Agenda133, Digital Europe134 and the EU Economic Security Strategy135, this
Challenge is expected to:
• Strengthen the European value chain of advanced materials in the energy,
mobility, electronics, and construction application areas.
• Enable a more diversified, digitally driven, and risk -aware configuration of the
European advanced materials value chain and associated processes and
technologies.
• Accelerate market uptake of advanced materials in the energy, mobility,
electronics, and construction industrial sectors.
• Address the EU’s industrial dependency on imports of resources, such as CRMs,
for the energy, mobility, electronics, and construction sectors.
Companies selected for support under this Challenge will become part of the wider
advanced materials ecosystem to be fostered by the different actions set out in the
Advanced Materials for Industrial Leadership, amongst these the new co-programmed
partnership IAM4EU136.
Indicative budget: EUR 50 million
IV.2.2 Biotechnology driven low emission food and feed production
systems
Background and scope
Agriculture is the source of 11% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions, including over
54% of all methane (CH4) emissions. It is also the source of 94% of all ammonia (NH3)

emissions. Livestock generates GHG emissions from enteric fermentation  (CH4) and
from manure management (CH4 and N2O), contributing respectively to 48% and 17%
of total agricultural emissions. Furthermore, current agricultural practices that feature
an inefficient use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides also have a highly detrimental
effect on the biosphere and biodiversity.
Radically decreasing GHG emissions and the wider environmental footprint of the food
production system requires further action on several fronts. In keeping with the
ambitions of the Commission Communication on Building the future with nature:
Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU 137, a critical technology
identified under the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) 138, this
Challenge focuses on supporting novel biotechnology driven solutions in four areas,
(see Specific Objectives) which can in combination offer a GHG mitigation potential of
nearly 1.5 billion tons (tCO2e)139, through approaches that:
• Replace fossil fuels in  the production of pesticides and fertilizers used in
agriculture;
• Achieve efficiency in resource use and support the deployment of climate smart
agriculture (including livestock) technologies for sustainable food and feed
production;
• Mitigate enteric methane emissions from ruminants  and reduce the
environmental impact associated with some agricultural and animal farming
practices;
• Expand conventional food and feed production.
Specific Objectives
The start-ups and SMEs to be supported under this initiative must focus on one (or
more) of the following areas:
• Biotechnology for biopesticides 140, bio -stimulants, and fertilizers  of microbial
origin: This strand focuses on scaling breakthroughs in the use of
microorganisms or their biological components, and enzymatic or other
biotechnology-based processes using biomass residues/ waste streams in an

innovative and sustainable way for the production of renewable materials thus
contributing to the circular economy and preserving biodiversity.
• Biotechnology to support precision crop and livestock farming:  This covers
approaches that could for example leverage new plant breeding technologies
or enhance desirable traits through biotechnology to complement, and be
integrated with, precision crop and livestock farming approaches to help
increase yields and animal performance while reducing costs and optimising
process inputs while reducing waste streams.
• Biotechnology for ruminant methane mitigation: This includes approaches such
as novel feed components, feed processing for digestibility, advanced feed
additives and selective breeding, where compatible with livestock production
system of EU animal welfare standards
• Biotechnology for feed and food production: This focuses on precision
fermentation for the sustainable production of food and feed  ingredients
traditionally derived from animal or plant sources.
Regardless of the specific area addressed, companies are encouraged to leverage
digital tools such as AI, as appropriate, to facilitate the development of processes and
make the resulting products and services suitable for integration into existing
production systems.
All projects must provide a lifecycle assessment (LCA) considering environmental, social
and economic consideration. Proposals are also expected to consider regulatory
aspects alongside issues surrounding consumer acceptance and articulate suitable
strategies to support market entry within and beyond the EU.
Expected Outcomes and Impact
In support of the  Commission Communication on  Building the future with nature:

Indicative budget: EUR 50 million
IV.2.3 GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI
Background and scope
While Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are already delivering significant
improvements in healthcare, aiding climate change mitigation and adaptation,
enhancing production systems through predictive maintenance, and increasing the
security of European citizens and business, generative AI (GenAI) is expected to
revolutionize these fields further. GenAI promises a transformative impact on our daily
lives by significantly advancing capabilities across various domains.
GenAI however still faces notable challenges, such as unexplained inaccuracies (i.e.,
hallucinations) and a lack of transparency and accountability in decision-making, which
undermines trust  and poses questions regarding the safety and reliability of the
systems. These are even more critical in the case of  more advanced applications,
needing greater scale and integration within user workflows, particularly in sensitive or
safety-critical settings like clinical workflows  or the management of critical
infrastructures.
In line with the AI innovation package149 supporting Artificial Intelligence startups and
SMEs, and with the EU AI Act 150, targeted at the development, deployment and take -
up of trustworthy AI in the EU, this Challenge contributes to fostering a European,
human-centric approach to AI, that embodies EU values and works towards
guaranteeing Europe’s tech sovereignty  in a critical technology area identified under
the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)151.
The aim of this Challenge is to support  start-ups and SMEs committed to bringing
transformative AI-driven solutions to market. The proposed solutions should safeguard
human autonomy and enhance human expertise thus providing significant added value
to decision-making processes, services or industrial workflows. Novel solutions with
broad future applicability are particularly encouraged.
Specific Objectives

87

This Challenge will support start-ups and SMEs that are either:
• Further developing and validating new GenAI models;
• Adapting existing models to specific sectors or types of data where smaller
faster and more energy-efficient models would also be applicable; or
• Integrating and testing the GenAI solutions in existing workflows, and testing
these in regulatory sandboxes and real -life settings, including certification
and post-market surveillance, as appropriate.
The developed models must go beyond the state of the art and must look to overcome
the current difficulties that limit the extent to which they support human expertise with
a particular focus on  one of  the following areas, and in line with the sectors and
applications listed in the AI communication152:
- Healthcare: radiology is a frontrunner in the use of GenAI, but current solutions
suffer from a lack of trust and integration with clinical workflows, which must be
overcome to advance automatic radiology reporting and enhance human -AI
interaction while reducing interpretation errors and associated variability.
- Energy: the integration of GenAI in managing the power grid, alongside the
storage and use of renewables by grid operators, for example, calls for high
quality, reliable AI systems that deliver safe, real -time decision  making to
enhance resilience and planning.
- Security: security professionals including those operating critical infrastructures
can scale their work in threat and vulnerability detection and the subsequent
response to such threats, with the support of fault -tolerant, high quality and
secure AI systems.
- Public sector: leveraging GenAI to improve the quality, ease of access and
efficiency of public services, or to increase the efficiency of public administration
services and productivity.
- Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries: Gen AI systems targeted to the
needs of these sectors, catering for cultural and linguistic diversity and ensuring
transparency and full respect and recognition of artists and creators rights.
- Manufacturing: systems to enable mass customisation, enhance sustainability
and automation, propose options for design and identify maintenance needs.

152 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/communication-boosting-startups-and-innovation-trustworthy-

88

-  Education: Use of GenAI systems and assistants to enable personalised and
adaptive learning experiences, enhancing educational outcomes and
accessibility.
- Science: Leveraging GenAI to drive new levels of productivity and capability for
researchers in both the private  and public sectors, fostering innovation and
scientific advancements.
Expected Outcomes and Impact
This Challenge will support the further development and validation of Gen AI models
and/or downstream applications, which are “European -Value driven” and contributes
to the ambitions of the AI Act153 and the European approach to Artificial Intelligence154.
The AI models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU
concept for Trustworthy AI and the relevant ethical principles with due attention paid
to data quality, transparency & accountability, privacy, and security.
In the medium to longer term, it is expected to reduce dependencies and support
companies in leveraging the advances in generative AI , enhance their products and
develop new ones that:
• Optimise existing workflows: utilising Generative AI technologies to streamline
and improve operational processes across various industries;
• Enhance human capabilities: Applying advanced AI models to enhance decision-
making, creativity, and productivity;
• Are validated for application: Ensuring that the AI models are both advanced
and thoroughly validated for practical applicability  and scalability in real-world
scenarios.
The selected beneficiaries will receive favourable access to European supercomputing
resources for the training of their large foundation models, in the context of the AI
Factories in line with the EuroHPC regulation 155. In addition, they may benefit from
additional actions aimed at creating strategic partnerships with major industries or
attracting further capital. Where relevant, opportunities may be explored to provide
the selected beneficiaries with access to scientific datasets through the European Open
Science Cloud or to provide users of the European Open Science Cloud with access to
the tools developed by the beneficiaries.

Specific conditions
Any technology under this Challenge must be developed in a robust manner, paying
specific attention to safety, security and ethics considerations in future applications.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets,
interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid a situation of technological
dependency on a non-EU source, in a global context that requires the EU to take action
to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses,
vulnerabilities and high -risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its
ambitions. Projects under this challenge will contribute to ensure autonomy for Europe
in AI  and developing world -class technologies serving the needs of all types of
European industries providing top -performing solutions that industries will trust and
adopt to maintain their competitiveness. The contribution of these projects will be key
for the development of European industry in the area of AI. For this reason, and in line
with Article 136 of the Financial Regulation156, beneficiaries157 of grant-only Accelerator
funding must not be directly or indirectly controlled by a non-associated third country
or a legal entity established in a non -associated third country other than such third
countries or legal entities established in OECD member countries, Mercosur member
countries countries with which the EU cooperates under a Trade and Technology
Council, and countries with which the EU has a Digital Partnership 158.
Furthermore, in case of an investment support, specific safeguards may be introduced
in the investment agreement (see Introduction, section on Economic Security).

IV.2.4 Innovative in -space servicing, operations, robotics and technologies for
resilient EU space infrastructure
Background and scope
Satellites are currently designed, built and launched into space without the
functionalities to be serviced, repaired, upgraded or refuelled. In combination with
recent trends this has resulted in:

156 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509
157 i.e., the legal entities which sign the grant agreement.
158 OECD member countries have demonstrated a commitment to trustworthy and human-centric AI, as outlined by
their adoption of OECD principles. Collaboration with India, Singapore, and Mercosur countries fosters not only
technological advancements but also the  ethical and secure deployment of AI aligned with European values. The
Trade and Technology Council with India, the Digital Partnership with Singapore, and the Framework Cooperation
Agreement with Mercosur, serve to mitigate the strategic and technological  risks for collaboration with these
countries.

• Reduced operational lifetime of satellites due to collision avoidance
manoeuvres;
• Growing debris due to increased number of satellites, launch anomalies,
fragmentation events or explosions in orbit; and
• The need for in-space mobility, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geosynchronous Orbit
(GEO) transfer capabilities and the necessity to preserve orbital slots.
Furthermore, these spacecrafts are exposed to a number of space-based threats, such
as cyber, signal spoofing, R adio Frequency (RF) interferences, jamming and intrusion
that must be anticipated to ensure a resilient EU space-based infrastructure.
Approaches that extend the lifetime and protect in space infrastructure can thus offer
both essential resilience and significant cost savings for satellite operators and less
debris in space. However, despite the emerging commercial trend for in-orbit servicing,
Europe lacks cost -effective, cyber-secure, scalable, and resilient capabilities that can
deliver autonomous space operations. This encompasses the use of in-space robotics
to inspect, dock, capture and extend the lifetime of satellites. Such critica l capabilities
have increasing strategic importance considering the development of the next
generation of flexible, serviceable and resilient spacecraft that will require such
capabilities.
This Challenge therefore focuses on supporting companies developing cost -effective,
scalable and resilient solutions to service and/or augment satellite capabilities, perform
in-orbit refuelling, contribute to space debris reduction, and protect EU space
infrastructure. It develops capabilities in areas such as cyber security control
technologies, satellite -based secure connectivity, robots and robot -controlled
precision systems identified under the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform
(STEP)159, and thereby addresses risks to the EU’s future strategic autonomy.
Specific objectives
The start-ups and SMEs to be supported under this initiative must deliver solutions that
address one of the following areas:
• In-Orbit Servicing & Maintenance – This focuses on technologies to extend the
lifetime of satellites, reduce the number of dysfunctional satellites and address
deployment anomalies in orbit. It covers the full spectrum of activity including
inspection and maintenance, Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPOs),

159 Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform - European Union (europa.eu)
91

capture and docking alongside repair or the augmentation/ reconfiguration of
satellite capabilities.
• In-space transportation – This covers refuelling and recharging of spacecraft in
orbit, in -space mobility from LEO to GEO, orbital transfer vehicles and cost -
efficient propulsion for in-space mobility of spacecraft.
• Space-based resilience – This includes technologies that address space -based
cybersecurity threats for satcom, navigation, Earth Observation and In Orbit
servicing missions. It covers technologies tackling space -based cyber threats
such as encryption, frequency hopping, radio frequency fingerprinting, secure
on-board processing capabilities, AI for cybersecurity for autonomous RPO and
ones related to Space Situational Awarenes s, space weather and space debris
impacts.
Expected outcomes and impact
This challenge contributes to the strategic autonomy of the EU and to Strategic
Research and Innovation Agenda for Space R&I160, the EU Approach to Space Traffic
Management161, the EU In -Orbit Demonstration and Validation initiative (IOD/IOV) 162
and planned initiatives such as the in -Space Operations and Services (ISOS) pilot
mission under the Act in Space activities163,  notably by contributing satAPPs164 or other
component plug-ins to the ISOS Pilot Mission.
By developing and scaling up affordable and resilient in -space technologies the
Challenge is expected to:
• help enhance the resilience of European space infrastructure while extending
their lifetime and contribute to the management and reduction of space debris.
• increase the competitiveness of European companies in In -orbit satellites
servicing (IOS), In-space assembly and manufacturing (ISAM) and Active Debris
Removal (ADR) domains.
• contribute to supporting the scaling up of technologies for in -orbit satellite
servicing and maintenance, in -space transportation and space -based
cybersecurity resilience.

• generate new business opportunities, while delivering significant cost -savings
for satellite owners and operators who will find viable approaches to inspect,
protect and extend the operational lifetime of their satellites while reducing
space debris.
Specific conditions
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s strategic assets,
interests, and security, it is important to avoid a situation of technological dependency
on a non-EU source, in a global context that requires the EU to take action to build on
its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses,
vulnerabilities and high -risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its
ambitions. Projects under this Challenge will contribute to ensure open strategic
autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space -based infrastructures,
services applications and data, including by reinforcing European independent capacity
to access space, securing the autonomy of supply for critical technologies and
equipment, and fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness. For this reason, and
in line with Article 136 of the Financial Regulation 165, beneficiaries166 of grant -only
Accelerator funding must not be directly or indirectly controlled by a non -associated
third country or a legal entity established in a non-associated third country.
Furthermore, in case of an investment support, specific safeguards may be introduced
in the investment agreement (see Introduction, section on Economic Security).

IV.2.5 Breakthrough innovations for future mobility
Background and scope
The European Union has charted a path to climate neutrality by 2050 with an ambition
to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990
levels. The transport sector, including road transport, aviation, waterborne and rail, has
however been steadily increasing its emissions at an average yearly rate of 1.7% since
1990. The resulting emissions are also one of the main contributors to environ mental
and health problems, which are particularly acute in urban areas.
The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy167 includes an action plan to deliver on a
90% cut in mobility emissions by 2050, delivered by a smart, competitive, safe,
accessible, and affordable transport system. This encompasses all road vehicles,
aircraft, rail, waterborne vessels, infrastructure and new mobility services in increasingly
climate-neutral cities and rural areas.
The electrification of road transport alongside the increasing electrification and use of
zero and low carbon fuels of waterborne transport and aviation are expected to reduce
these emissions, but further breakthroughs beyond the drivetrain are needed to deliver
an effective and safe low emission transport system.
This Challenge therefore focuses on supporting companies developing cost -effective
and scalable deep tech breakthroughs that will help deliver reductions in mobility -
related emissions in its many facets, from the manufacture of vehicles to their use. It
also includes approaches that deliver improvements in the efficiency of the transport
system through for example the use of digital tools. It thereby develops capabilities in
areas such as sensing, manufacturing and resource efficient technologies alongside
sustainable alternative fuels  identified under the Strategic Technologies for Europe
Platform (STEP)168, and thereby addresses risks to the EU’s future strategic autonomy.
Energy vectors based on electrification and hydrogen fall outside the scope of this
Challenge call but can be supported through the Open calls. However, digital tools for
charging and capacity management are in scope.
Specific objectives
The start -ups and SMEs to be supported under this Challenge must focus on
developing cost-effective and scalable solutions that deliver against at least one of the
following areas:

167 Mobility Strategy - European Commission (europa.eu)
168 Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform - European Union (europa.eu)
94

• Breakthroughs in the design, manufacture, assembly and operation of road
vehicles, waterborne vessels, aircraft, or rail that contribute significantly to
reduce their environmental footprint;
• Disruptive technologies that contribute to increase operational efficiencies and
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, secondary and other harmful emissions
and noise for Heavy Duty road vehicles, waterborne vessels, aircraft or rail,
multimodal transport and/or their related infrastructure;
• Sustainable fuels for hard -to-abate sectors such as aviation and maritime,
including retrofitting solutions; and
• Breakthroughs in the development and integration of digital tools ranging from
sensors to the application of Artificial Intelligence to enhance autonomous
transport solutions and more sustainable energy use on land, water or in the air,
improve the connectivity and efficiency of vehicles and the transport system
including capacity management , and smart and bi -directional charging
functionalities.
Projects must take into account the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD)
framework169, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and circularity approaches.
Companies selected under this Challenge will become part of the ecosystem fostered
under the European industrial partnerships in the areas of Clean Aviation, Towards
zero-emission road transport (2ZERO), Connected, Cooperative and Automated
Driving (CCAM), Zero-emission waterborne transport and Transforming Europe's rail
system. Furthermore, connections with the Industrial Alliance “Renewable and Low -
Carbon Fuels Value Chain”170 will be encouraged.
Expected outcomes and impact
This Challenge contributes to the strategic autonomy to the EU, the objectives of the
European Green Deal171, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy 172 and the Net-
Zero Industry Act173, which seeks to foster the EU’s net-zero technology industrial base
- products, components, and equipment necessary for manufacturing net -zero
technologies - to deliver an affordable, reliable, and sustainable clean transport system.

95

By developing and scaling up breakthrough innovations for future mobility, the
Challenge is expected to:
• increase the competitiveness and economic autonomy or security of European
companies across the mobility value chain;
• support the scaling up of technologies that materially reduce mobility -related
emissions, including a quantification on how they reduce emissions or increase
efficiency of transport, or provide more affordable or inclusive mobility;
• deliver improvements in accessibility, safety, security, connectivity, flexibility and
efficiency of the transport system including new mobility services and models;
• develop new skills and create jobs in the EU.

for larger funding rounds.
You will therefore need to demonstrate that the company already has a pre -
commitment181 for an equity investment which meets the following elements:
❖ The pre-commitment is from a qualified investor182, .
❖ The pre -commitment represents at least 20% of the total target funding
round you are aiming to raise.
The following entities are eligible to apply:
❖ A single company classified as a SME or small mid-cap (up to 499 employees)
established within a Member State or an Associated Country (see Annex 2).
The company may have a holding entity for the purposes of the investment,
and this holding company must also be established in a Member State or an
Associated Country.
❖ An investor may submit a proposal on behalf of an eligible SME or small mid-
cap as defined above, provided that a prior agreement exists with the
company. The investment agreement will be signed with the selected SME
or small mid-cap.

181 The pre-commitment is non-legally binding in nature and will be assessed at the time of proposal evaluation.
182In case the pre-committed investor is not the lead investor, then the EIC Fund investment will be subject to the
participation of the qualified lead investor as defined in the EIC Investment Guidelines available on the EIC website.
99

The applicable admissibility and eligibility conditions are detailed in Annex 2  unless

privileged access to funding and support from other EU programmes and other funders
and investors186.
How do you apply; how long does it take?
You may submit an application to the EIC STEP Scale Up call at any time.  The
evaluations of applications submitted will be organised at regular intervals depending
on the number of applications, with at least one per quarter or more frequently in
urgent cases. You must submit your proposal via the EU Funding and Tenders Portal.
1. Submission of proposals
The proposal consists of:
❖ a full business plan , including information on the company’s ownership and
financial structure and a justification on the STEP related objectives (maximum
50 pages);
❖ a pitch-deck (maximum 15 pages) in pdf format;
❖ a pre-commitment from a qualified investor (according to a template available
on the EIC website);
❖ An ownership control declaration.
All personal data and information in your proposal will be kept strictly confidential.
However, before submitting your full proposal, you will need to give consent to share
necessary information with the EIC Fund.
In addition, you will be asked as part of your application whether your company would
be interested in Venture Debt support from InvestEU implementing partners187.

application, with an additional flexibility amount of maximum EUR 5 million per
proposal. The flexibility amount is to enable the EIC Fund to make an investment
decision for a higher amount than requested if justified to take account of
developments of the company since the date of application and the opportunity of
catalysing a larger overall funding round with co -investors. The additional flexibility
amount may only be used if there are sufficient amounts available on the EIC Fund
accounts (e.g., due to budget available from other investments).
The relevant information from your proposal will be passed to the investment adviser
for the EIC Fund, to proceed with the detailed due diligence and subject to a positive
due diligence and subsequent EIC Fund Investment Committee decision, the
investment agreement.
If you have expressed an interest and given consent, the relevant information from your
proposal will be passed to the relevant InvestEU implementing partners to consider for
Venture Debt support.
How does the EIC decide if your proposal will be selected for a potential
investment by the EIC Fund?
Your proposal will be assessed on its merits by leading experts and the Commission
will ensure open and fair competition to all eligible proposals submitted.
The EIC STEP Scale Up call utilizes a "first come, first served" approach to evaluate
proposals. However, juries will be asked to take account of overall budget availability
for the full year and will be limited to recommend proposals amounting to no more
than 70% of the available budget for the calendar year within the first six months of
the year. The Jury will be informed about budget availability, including additional
amounts that may be available due to previous amounts awarded that were not fully

VII. EIC Prizes
VII.1 The European Prize for Women Innovators
Objectives and scope
Facing fast-paced developing technologies and science, it is crucial to involve women
and girls in the design, development and up -take of innovative solutions. Achieving
gender equality and diversity benefits not only individuals, but also increases the
performance of business, research and innovation.
Nevertheless, women continue to face multiple barriers, in bringing new ideas to the
market and raising capital for their companies. This negatively affects the success rate
of women -founded businesses and perpetuates the lack of awareness about the
systemic nature of gender inequality. Hence, women’s efforts and contributions to
science and innovation should be encouraged and supported.
The European Commission put in place a Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025198, which
sets out the Commission’s broader commitment to equality across all EU policies.
As outlined in the New European Innovation Agenda199, supporting women innovators
strengthens the European research and innovation system and creates gender -equal
working environments where all talents can thrive. By integrating a gender dimension
in projects, research quality is improved as well as the production of the knowledge,
technologies and innovations.
The European Prize for Women Innovators celebrates the women entrepreneurs behind
Europe’s game-changing innovations, so that they may inspire other women and girls
realise their full potential as the EU’s future scientists, innovators, and tech leaders.
This prize supports a culture within research and innovation organisations and
companies allowing women to become the innovators and entrepreneurs of tomorrow.
The prize is awarded every year to women from across the EU and countries associated
to Horizon Europe, who have transformed their ideas into disruptive innovations to
benefit people and the planet and who are inspiring leaders.
As for the previous edition, the 2026 European Prize for Women Innovators is
organised in coord ination between  the Agency and the European Institute of
Innovation & Technology (EIT). The winners are chosen by an independent expert jury.

VII.2 The European Capital of Innovation Awards (iCapital)
Cities and/or towns are faced with most severe societal and sustainability challenges
but do also have the means to develop, promote, and apply effective innovative
solutions. They are the place where ideas, people, public and private actors meet and
engage to improve the quality of life of citizens. They are the natural playground where
breakthrough innovations flourish and nourish. They provide ground to experiment
new technologies and products in a real environment, their interaction with people and
their added value.
Objectives and Scope
The traditional city innovation ecosystem is opening to new models of innovation
engaging citizens , ensuring their involvement in the decision -making process, and
reinforcing democracy and rights. An increasing number of cities are acting as test beds
for innovation and run people-driven initiatives to find solutions to societal challenges,
such as climate change, digitalisation, sustainable growth or social cohesion, including
through new endeavours such as nature-based solutions and EU Missions
The public domain is particularly challenged with finding effective ways to ensure the
mainstreaming of these practices into the ordinary urban development process.
Successful practices are particularly crucial to enhance the city’s capacity to attract and
retain new resources, funds and talents to stimulate the growth of breakthrough
innovations. Moreover, collaboration and strengthening synergies among innovation
ecosystems boost cities’ development and resilience to tackle urban challenges and
inspires many other cities follow a similar path.
The New European Innovation Agenda208 sets out a vision for harnessing the power of
innovation to drive economic growth, social progress, and contribute to the green and
digital transition in Europe. The agenda emphasizes the need for strategic investments
in key technologies, including deep tech, and for strengthening and better connecting
innovation ecosystems through stronger collaboration between regions, to close the
innovation divide.
For this reason, the European Capital of Innovation Awards will recognize the cities’
role as catalysers of the local innovation ecosystem and will stimulate new activities
aimed at boosting game-changing innovation.
Categories
In this edition, the European Capital of Innovation Awards will feature two categories.

VIII.11 Support for Ukrainian tech SMEs and startups

Rationale
Following Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked  military invasion of Ukraine on 24
February 2022, Horizon Europe has, alongside other international stakeholders and EU
Member States, provided essential support to Ukraine’s research and innovation
ecosystem, both in the form of access to funding, through actions with ring -fenced
funding for Ukraine, and measures to enhance Ukraine’s participation in the actions of
Horizon Europe not specifically targeting Ukraine's participation.
Under the EIC a dedicated support measure, namely the Seeds of Bravery  project221,
was funded  under the EIC Work Programme 2022 222 to support the integration of
Ukrainian tech SMEs and startups  into European ecosystems and to enhance their
operations in Ukraine. While this initiative serves its purpose, it also shows the need for
further support for the most promising companies (beyond funding available via
cascading grants within the Seeds of Bravery).
Ukrainian tech SMEs and startups demonstrate a significant potential for creating
breakthrough innovations, which are both scalable and global, thus they contribute to
the Ukrainian economic growth and integration into the European single market. Many
innovations created by Ukrai nian companies have been successfully commercialised.
Continuous support in these efforts is needed and particularly timely given Russia’s
continue war of aggression against Ukraine.
This call will increase the innovation support to individual Ukrainian  tech SMEs and
startups to develop and scale up their technologies and products. This would include
startups developing deep -tech innovative solutions/services/products, especially in
prominent priority areas for Ukraine (e.g. cybersecurity; artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning; robotics and autonomous systems; satellite , space and maritime
technologies; advanced materials; biotechnology; semiconductors ) and companies
working on deep -tech innovative solutions/services/products for rebuilding and
recovery efforts in Ukraine.
Scope

221 Grant agreement ID: 101104445.
222 Under the action “ Pan-European network of startup associations to support the integration of Ukrainian tech
innovators into European ecosystems and to enhance their operations in Ukraine”.
133

This action focuses on deep -tech startups which 1) have high -impact innovation
technology, product, service, or business model that could create new markets or
disrupt existing ones, and 2) have the ambition and commitments to scale up.
The successful applicants are expected to work on the deep-tech innovation within the
abovementioned priority areas. Such companies often struggle to attract financing
because the technology and investment risks are too high.
This topic is designed to enable promising deep-tech startups to develop further their
innovations from at least TRL 4 (technology fully validated in a lab) and attract the
investment amounts needed for scale up in a shorter timeframe.
The applicants are expected to demonstrate in their application that they:
- have developed technology validated in the lab level (at least all aspects of TRL
4 completed)
- have the potential to reach application and market in period of 2-3 years;
- possess the necessary Intellectual Property Rights to ensure freedom to operate
and adequate protection of the idea;
- have a clear vision on the intended pathway and route to market. This includes
specific milestones together with concrete and verifiable KPIs to assess progress
towards the market.
Applications from women-led companies are encouraged.
If relevant, for those applicant companies that are currently located in an EU Member
State or Horizon Europe Associated Country,  a clear intention to relocate back the
company to Ukraine whenever feasible is expected.

Expected impacts
The proposed action is expected to support the Ukrainian tech SMEs and start-ups and
SMEs to enable them to better attract private investments, deploy innovations on the
market, and scale up. The activities funded should be for civilian applications only.
The requested grant is expected to be used for:
- addressing investors and test/validate the market readiness towards
commercialisation and deployment (market research, value proposition,
business case and business model, prospects for growth, intellectual property
protection, competitor analysis etc.) an d if relevant, aspects of regulation,
134

certification and standardisation, aimed at getting both the technology and the
business idea investment ready; and/or;
- the maturation and validation of novel technologies beyond proof of concept
to viable demonstrators of the technology in the intended field of application
(i.e. from minimum TRL 4 to at least TRL 6-7).
At the end of the project, beneficiaries should:
- demonstrate that the technology component of their innovation has been
tested and validated in a laboratory and other relevant environment (at least all
aspects of TRL 5 completed, preferably higher);
- be ready to apply for EIC Accelerator and/or to seek other investors or sources
of funding to enter licensing or collaboration agreements with third parties, or
other routes to market deployment;
- benefit from increased global visibility and access to funding and European and
global markets.
Successful applicants will be granted free access to the EIC Business Acceleration
Services, such as coaching and specific events tailored to their needs (e.g. for improving
their attractiveness towards investor and market readiness).
Successful applicants will also be eligible for the Fast Track to the EIC Accelerator, which
provides access to larger grants and EIC Fund investments.
Specific conditions
Participation in this call is limited to single companies classified as SMEs  (including
startups) that are:
- established in Ukraine; or
- previously established in Ukraine and relocated to an EU Member State or
Horizon Europe Associated Country, after 24 February 2022 (including Ukrainian
startups that received a startup visa in Europe after this date). Such companies

Annex 2 General conditions
These general conditions set out the general conditions applicable to calls and topics
for grants and other forms of funding under the EIC Work Programme 2025. They also
describe the evaluation and award procedures and other criteria for Horizon Europe
EIC funding.
If a call or topic deviates from the general conditions or includes additional conditions,
this is explicitly stated for the call or topic in the main part of this EIC Work Programme.
Applicants are invited to read the call documentation on the topic page of the EU
Funding & Tenders portal (‘Portal’) carefully, and particularly these Annexes, the
Horizon Europe Programme Guide 234, the EU Funding & Tenders Portal Online
Manual235 and the EU Grants AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement236. These documents
provide clarifications and answers to potential questions on preparing the application.
A. ADMISSIBILITY
Applications must be submitted before the call deadline.
Applications must be submitted electronically directly via the Funding and Tender
portal electronic submission system (accessible via the call page in the Search Funding
and Tenders section). Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Applications must be submitted using the forms provided inside the electronic
submission system (not the templates available on the call page, which are only for
information). The structure and presentation must correspond to the instructions given
in the forms.
Applications must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory Annexes and
supporting documents (see part E below). Applications must be readable, accessible,
printable.
The page limits and sections subject to limits will be clearly shown in the application
templates and must be respected. If an application exceeds the limits, there will be an
automatic warning and invitation to re -submit a version that conforms to these limits.
Excess pages will be automatically made invisible and will not be taken into
consideration by the evaluators.

234 The Horizon Europe Programme Guide outlines the detailed guidance on the structure, budget and political
priorities of Horizon Europe.
235 The Online Manual outlines the procedures to register and submit applications online via the EU Funding &
Tenders Portal and recommendations on preparing the application.
236 The AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement contains detailed annotations on all the provisions in the grant
agreement that must be signed to obtain the grant.
141

For the EIC Accelerator  (incl. EIC STEP) , the applicant must not be in a situation of
concurrent submission/implementation . Concurrent submission exists when an
applicant submits more than one proposal for evaluation to any EIC Accelerator call
before the evaluation feedback has been provided for the earlier submission. If a case
of concurrent submission is identified, only the proposal submitted last (before the
deadline) will be taken into consideration. Concurrent implementation occurs when the
awardee of an ongoing EIC Accelerator/EIC Pilot/SME Instrument grant project submits
another full proposal with a grant component  before the first project reaches its end
date.237
B. ELIGIBILITY
B.1 Entities eligible to participate
Any legal entity,238 regardless of its place of establishment, including legal entities from
non-associated third countries or international organisation (including international
European research organisations)239 is eligible to participate (whether it is eligible for
funding or not) , provided that the conditions laid down in the Horizon Europe
Regulation240 have been met together with any other conditions laid down in the
specific call or topic.
According to Article 2(16) of the HE Regulation241, ‘Legal entity’ means any natural or
legal person created and recognised as such under national law, EU law or international
law, which has legal personality and which may, acting in its own name, exercise rights
and be subject to obligations, or an entity wi thout legal personality  as referred to in
point (c) of Article 200(2) of the Financial Regulation.242
Beneficiaries and affiliated entities must register in the  Participant Register  before
submitting their application, in order to get a participant identification code (PIC) and
be validated by the Central Validation Service before signing the grant agreement. For

237 Ongoing grant-only projects selected under a Horizon 2020 EIC pilot Accelerator or under Horizon Europe EIC
Accelerator call may be eligible to submit a proposal for a blended finance or an investment only support under an
EIC Accelerator call.
Ongoing blended finance projects selected under a Horizon 2020 EIC pilot Accelerator call may be eligible to submit
a proposal for a related investment component under an EIC Accelerator call.
238 For the definition of ‘legal entity’, see Article 2 (16) Regulation (EU) 2021/695 as well as Article 203(2)(c) , EU
Financial Regulation 2024/2509 .
239 International European research organisation means an international organisation, the majority of whose
members are Member States or Associated Countries, and whose principal objective is to promote scientific and
technological cooperation in Europe (Article 2 (15) Regulation (EU) 2021/695).
240 Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28  April 2021 establishing Horizon
Europe (OJ L 170 , 12.5.2021, p. 1).

the validation, they will be asked to upload the necessary documents showing their
legal status and origin during the grant preparation stage. A validated PIC is not a
prerequisite for submitting an application.
For more information, see Rules for Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
Specific cases:
Affiliated entities — Affiliated entities (i.e. entities with a legal or capital link  to a
beneficiary243 which participate in the action with similar rights and obligations to the
beneficiaries, but which do not sign the grant agreement and therefore do not become
beneficiaries themselves) are allowed, if they are eligible for participation and funding.
Associated partners — Associated partners (i.e. entities which participate in the action
without signing the grant agreement, and without the right to charge costs or claim
contributions) are allowed, subject to any specific call/topic conditions.
Entities without legal personality  — Entities which do not have legal personality
under their national law may exceptionally participate, provided that their
representatives have the capacity to undertake legal obligations on their behalf, and
offer guarantees to protect the EU’s financial  interests equivalent to those offered by
legal persons244.
EU bodies — Legal entities created under EU law including decentralised agencies may
be part of the consortium, unless provided for otherwise in their basic act.
Joint Research Centre  (‘JRC’)— Where provided for in the specific call/topic
conditions, applicants may include in their proposals the possible contribution of the
JRC but the JRC will not participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal.
Applicants will indicate the contribution that the JRC could bring to the project based
on the scope of the topic text. After the evaluation process, the JRC and the consortium
selected for funding may come to an agreement on the specific terms of the
participation of the JRC. If an agreement is found, the JRC may accede to the grant
agreement as beneficiary requesting zero funding or participate as an associated
partner and would accede to the consortium as a member.
Associations and interest groupings  — Entities composed of members (e.g.
European research infrastructure consortia (ERICs)) may participate as ‘sole
beneficiaries’ or ‘beneficiaries without legal personality’245. However, if the action is in

243 Article 190 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
244 Article 200(2)(c) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
245 Articles 201(2) and 200(2)(c) EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
143

practice implemented by the individual members, those members should also
participate either as beneficiaries or as affiliated entities (otherwise their costs will NOT
be eligible).
Restrictions:
Restrictions on participation in Innovation Actions, including the EIC Accelerator,
for entities established in China  — In accordance with the 2019 “EU-China - A
Strategic outlook” communication, the 2021 “Global Approach to Research and
Innovation” communication, and the joint conclusions of the 4 th EU-China Innovation
Cooperation Dialogue of 2019, an exercise to develop a Joint Roadmap for the future
of EU-China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation (Roadmap) has been
established between the EU and China. It has the objective to develop  a level playing
field for engagement between the EU and China in the areas of science, technology,
and innovation (STI) that is respectful of fundamental research and innovation values
and principles. This endeavor is to be achieved through an agreement on the
framework conditions contained in the Roadmap and their monitoring and evaluation.
As progress so  far has mainly taken place on the framework conditions linked to
research rather than on those related to innovation, and taking into account the nature
and objectives in particular of Innovation Actions, cooperation with entities established
in China needs to be calibrated accordingly.
Legal entities established in China are therefore not eligible to participate in Horizon
Europe Innovation Actions, including the EIC Accelerator, in any capacity. This includes
participation as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, third parties giving
in-kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties
(if any). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons. The
above eligibility criteria may be reviewed in the future in accordance with policy
developments. This exclusion is justified given the substantive concerns regarding the
use of intellectual property generated under this publicly funded programme, and the
ongoing discussions between China and the EU on the Joint Roadmap for the future
of EU-China cooperation in science, technology, and innovation.
Restrictions for the protection of European communication networks — The
protection of European communication networks has been identified as an important
security interest of the Union and its Member States. 246 In line with the Commission
Recommendation on the cybersecurity of 5G networks of 2019247 and the subsequent

246 European Council conclusions of 1 and 2 October 2020 (EUCO 13/20), point 11; Council Conclusions on the significance of 5G
to the European Economy and the need to mitigate security risks linked to 5G, 14517/19.
247 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/534 of 26 March 2019 Cybersecurity of 5G networks, L 88/42.

report on EU coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks of
2019,248 the EU Toolbox on 5G cybersecurity,249 the second report on Member States’
progress in implementing the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of 2023, 250 and the
related Communication on the implementation of the 5G cybersecurity toolbox of
2023,251 the Commission together with the Member States has worked to jointly
identify and assess cyberthreats and security risks for 5G networks.252 The toolbox also
recommends adding country-specific information (e.g. threat assessment from national
security services, etc.). This work is an essential component of the Security Union
Strategy and supports the protection of electronic communications networks and other
critical infrastructures.
Entities assessed as “high-risk suppliers”, are currently set out in the second report on
Member States’ progress in implementing the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity of
2023253 and the related Communication on the implementation of the 5G cybersecurity
toolbox of 2023254.
The toolbox also underlines that further developing European capacities in the area of
5G and post -5G technologies by leveraging EU Research & Innovation Funding
programmes is a strategic risk mitigating measure. This entails the need to avoid the
participation of high -risk supplier entities in the development of other technologies
linked to the evolution of European communication networks to prevent technology
transfer and the persistence of dependencies in materials, semiconductor components
(including pr ocessors), computing resources, software tools and virtualisation
technologies, as well as related cybersecurity.
In order to protect the specific policy requirements of the Union and/or its Member
States, it is therefore appropriate that the following additional eligibility criteria apply
to proposals under Pathfinder Challenges identified as “subject to restrictions for the
protection of European communication networks” as well as  , Pathfinder Open  and
Transition calls that concern the evolution of European communication networks (5G,
post-5G and other technologies linked to the evolution of European communication
networks):

Entities that are assessed as high -risk suppliers of mobile network communication
equipment (and any entities they own or control) are not eligible to participate as
beneficiaries, affiliated entities and associated partners.
The assessment is based on the following criteria:
• likelihood of interference from a non-associated third country, for example due to:
− the characteristics of the entity’s ownership or governance (e.g. state-owned
or controlled, government/party involvement);
− the characteristics of the entity’s business and other conduct (e.g. a strong
link to a third country government);
− the characteristics of the respective third country (e.g. legislation or
government practices likely to affect the implementation of the action,
including an offensive cyber/intelligence policy, pressure regarding place of
manufacturing or access to information).
• (cyber-)security practices, including throughout the entire supply chain;
• risks identified in relevant assessments of Member States and third countries as well
as other EU institutions, bodies and agencies, if relevant.

Exceptions may be requested from the  Agency and will be assessed case -by-case,
taking into account the criteria provided for in the 5G cybersecurity toolbox, the
security risks and availability of alternatives in the context of the action.
EU restrictive measures —Entities subject to EU restrictive measures  under Article 29
of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 215 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU (TFEU)  255 as well as Article 75 TFEU 256 are not eligible to
participate in any capacity, including as beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated
partners, third parties giving in -kind contributions, subcontractors or recipients of
financial support to third parties (if any).
Applicants to the EIC Accelerator undertake that their Ultimate Beneficial Owners are
not listed and, moreover, do not do business with customers, or make funds or
economic resources available to, or for the benefit of (directly or indirectly) any natural
or legal person designated under EU sanctions (Obligation of Result).

255 Please note that the EU Official Journal contains the official list and, in case of conflict, its content prevails over
that of the EU Sanctions Map.
256 Please note that the EU Official Journal contains the official list and, in case of conflict, its content prevails over
that of the EU Sanctions Map.
146

Special rules also apply to entities covered by Commission Guidelines No 2013/C
205/05257 .
Legal entities established in Russia, Belarus, or in non -government-controlled
territories of Ukraine  — Given the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the
involvement of Belarus, there is currently no appropriate context allowing the
implementation of the actions foreseen in this programme with legal entities
established in Russia, Belarus, or in non -government-controlled territories of Ukraine.
Therefore, even where such entities are not subject to EU restrictive measures, such
legal entities are not eligible to participate in any capacity. This includes participation
as beneficiaries, affiliated entit ies, associated partners, third parties giving in -kind
contributions, subcontractors or recipients of financial support to third parties (if any).
Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for justified reasons.
With specific regard to measures addressed to Russia, following the adoption of the
Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1745 of 24 June 2024 (amending Council Regulation (EU)
No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014) concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s
actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, legal entities established outside Russia
but whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by a
legal person, entity or body established in Russia are also not eligible to participate in
any capacity.
Measures for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the
principles of the rule of law in Hungary  — Following the Council Implementing
Decision (EU) 2022/2506 , as of 16 December 2022, no legal commitments can be
entered into with Hungarian public interest trusts established under the Hungarian Act
IX of 2021 or any entity they maintain. Affected entities may continue to apply to calls
for proposals and can participate without receiving funding, as associated partners, if
allowed by the call conditions. However, as long as the Council measures are not lifted,
such entities are not eligible to participate in any funded role (beneficiaries, affiliated
entities, subcontractors, recipients of financial support to third parties, etc.). In case of
multi-beneficiary grant calls, applicants will be invited to remove or replace that entity
in any funded role and/or to change its status into associated partner. Tasks and
budget may be redistributed accordingly.
Restrictions on control in Accelerator grant-only actions – In line with Article 136
of the Financial Regulation258, where necessary and duly justified and in line with Article

257 Commission guidelines No 2013/C 205/05 on the eligibility of Israeli entities and their activities in the territories
occupied by Israel since June 1967 for grants, prizes and financial instruments funded by the EU from 2014 onwards
(OJEU C 205 of 19.07.2013, pp. 9-11).
258 Regulation - 2021/695 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)
147

136 of the Financial Regulation, participation as a beneficiary259 in Accelerator grant-
only actions may, as an additional eligibility condition, be limited to legal entities which
are not directly or indirectly controlled by a non -eligible third country or by a legal
entity established in a non -eligible third country. Unless otherwise stated, such non -
eligible countries are all countries other than EU Member Sta tes and Associated
Countries.

265 This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the
individual positions of the Member States on this issue.
149

Associated partners  — Entities not eligible for funding (and therefore not able to
participate as beneficiaries) may participate as associated partners, unless specified
otherwise in the specific call/topic conditions.
Coordination and Support Actions – To be eligible to participate as beneficiaries (or
affiliated entities) in ‘Coordination and support’ actions, legal entities must be
established in a Member State or Associated Country, unless the specific call/topic
conditions provide otherwise (in which case the general rules for eligibility for funding
apply). Legal entities established in a non -associated third country may, however,
participate in ‘Coordination and support’ actions as associated partners, unless this is
explicitly excluded by the specific call/topic conditions.
EU bodies  — Legal entities created under EU law may also be eligible to receive
funding, unless their basic act states otherwise.
International organisations  — International European research organisations are
eligible to receive funding. International organisations with headquarters in a Member
State or Associated Country are eligible to receive funding for ‘Training and mobility’
actions or when provided for  in the specific call/topic conditions. Other international
organisations are not eligible to receive funding , unless provided for in the specific
call/topic conditions, or if their participation is considered essential for imple menting
the action by the Agency.
B.3 Single legal entity (‘Mono-beneficiary’) and consortium (‘multi-beneficiary’)
composition
Unless otherwise provided for in the specific call/topic conditions:
 Applicants for mono-beneficiary actions must be established in a Member State
or Associated Country.
 Proposals for multi -beneficiary action s: proposals must be submitted by a
consortium including as beneficiaries, at least three legal entiti es, independent
from each other and each established in a different country as follows:
- at least one independent legal entity established in a Member State; and
- at least two other independent legal entities, each established in different
Member States or Associated Countries.
As affiliated entities do not sign the grant agreement, they do not count towards the
minimum eligibility criteria for consortium composition (if any).
The JRC, international European research organisations and legal entities created under
EU law are deemed to be established in a Member State other than those in which the
other legal entities participating in the action are established.
150

Applications for Coordination and Support actions may be submitted by one or more
legal entities, which must be established in a Member State, Associated Country, or in
exceptional cases and if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions, in another
third country.266
B.4. Eligible activities
Eligible activities are the ones described in the call conditions. Applications will only be
considered eligible if their content corresponds, wholly or in part, to the topic
description for which it is submitted.
Projects must focus on civil applications and must not:
 aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes;
 intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such
changes heritable (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment
of the gonads, which may be financed);
 intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the
purpose of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear
transfer;
Projects must, moreover, comply with EU policy interests and priorities (environment,
social, security, industrial policy, etc.).
B.5 Do Not Significant Harm (DNSH) principle
Innovations that significantly harm the environment (and therefore contravene the ‘do
not significant harm’ principle of the EU Taxonomy Regulation),267social welfare or that
are primarily designed for military applications, or in other fields which are generally
excluded from EU funding pursuant to Article 18 Horizon Europe Regulation, will not
be funded.
In general, EIC funding will not be awarded to projects that contravene the objectives
of the Green Deal, including for example proposals dedicated to enhancing the use of
fossil fuels and related technologies. Exceptions might be established, however, for
activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from certain fossil fuel -based
energy sources, such as those covered by the Complementary Climate Delegated Act268

266 Consortia of two entities must be comprised of independent legal entities from two different Member States or
Associated Countries. Consortia of three or above entities follow standard rules i.e. they must include at least one
legal entity established in a Member State and  at least two other independent legal entities, each established in
different Member States or Associated Countries (see Annex 2).
267 Regulation - 2020/852 - EN - taxonomy regulation - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)

151

under the Taxonomy Regulation. For example, this delegated act recognises that, under
strict conditions, specific fossil gas -related activities that  can help accelerate the
transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon
gases are in line with the EU’s climate and environmental objectives.269
B.6 Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence
All AI -based systems or techniques need to be developed in a safe, secure and
responsible manner, with a clear identification of and preventative approach to risks
and in accordance with the AI Act. Depending on the type of research being proposed
(from basic to precompetitive) and as appropriate, AI -based systems or techniques
should be, or be developed to become (implicitly or explicitly contributing to the
following objectives):
 technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform
about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed
risk posed by the AI-based system or technique;
 socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which
they operate;
 reliable and function as intended, minimising unintentional and unexpected
harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental
integrity of humans;  able to provide a suitable explanation of its decision -
making process, whenever an AI-based system can have a significant impact on
people’s lives.
All proposals involving the development, use and/or deployment of AI based
system/technique must ensure that the proposed AI system/technique is technical
robust (e.g., resilient to attack, safe and secure, having fallback plan, accurate, reliable
and reproducible), safe and must describe how they will uphold the principles of human
agency and oversight, fairness, gender neutral, diversity, non-discrimination, societal
and environmental well-being, transparency and accountability.
B.7 Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
Where the specific call/topic conditions require a Technology Readiness Level (TRL),
the definitions set out in the Glossary apply, unless otherwise specified.


152

B.8 Ethics
Projects must comply with ethical principles (including the highest standards of
research integrity) and applicable EU, international and national law.
Applicants must have completed the ethics self-assessment as part of their application.
 For more information, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment.
Projects involving ethics issues will have to undergo an ethics review to authorise
funding and may be made subject to specific ethics requirements. These requirements
become part of the grant agreement as ethics deliverables, e .g. ethics committee
opinions/authorisations required under national or EU law.
B.9 Security — EU classified and sensitive information
Projects involving classified and/or security sensitive information will have to go
through the security appraisal process to authorise funding and may be made subject
to specific security rules (detailed in a Security Section, which is annexed to the grant
agreement). Specific provisions for EU -classified information (EUCI) and sensitive
information (SEN) will be included in the grant agreement, as necessary and
appropriate.
The rules for protecting EU -classified information (governed by Commission Decision
(EU, Euratom) 2015/444270 and/or national rules) provide for instance that:
 projects involving information classified TRES SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET (or
equivalent) can NOT be funded;
 EU-classified information must be marked in accordance with the applicable
security instructions in the Security Classification Guide appendix of the Security
Aspects Letter (SAL) which is contained in the Security Section of the grant

UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if required
by national rules) may take place only on the premises of entities which have
been granted a facility security clearance (FSC) issue by the competent national
security authority NSA);

270 See Commission Decision 2015/ 444/EU, Euratom of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU
classified information (OJ L 72, 17.3.2015, p. 53.

153

 handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL or
above (and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, if required by national rules) may
take place only in a secured area accredited by the competent NSA;
 access to and handling of information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU
CONFIDENTIAL or above may be granted only to individuals with a valid
personnel security clearance (PSC) and an established need-to-know, who have
been briefed on the applicable security rules;
 access to, and handling of, information classified RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED
may be granted only to individuals who have a need -to-know and have been
briefed on the applicable security rules;
 at the end of the grant, the classified information must either be returned or
continue to be protected according to the applicable rules;
 subcontracting of tasks involving EU -classified information is subject to prior
written approval by the European Commission, which is the originator of EU -
classified information. It is only possible to subcontract these tasks to entities
established in an EU Member State or in a non -EU country with a security of
information agreement with the EU (or an administrative arrangement with the
Commission);
 disclosure of EU-classified information is subject to prior written approval by the
European Commission.
Depending on the type of activity, FSC s may have to be provided before the grant is
signed. The Agency will assess this for each case and fix the delivery date during the
grant preparation stage. It is not possible to sign any grant agreement before at least
one of the beneficiaries in the consortium has an FSC.
In certain cases, the project results might not require classification , but they might be
sensitive and require restricted disclosure or limited dissemination for security reasons,
according to the applicable security instructions in the Security Section. This means
that, in principle, third parties should have no access to results subject to this type of
restriction. Disclosure of this information is subject to prior written approval by the
European Commission.
Further security recommendations may be added to the grant and contract agreement
in the form of security deliverables (e.g. establishing a security advisory board,
appointing a project security officer, limiting the level of detail, us ing a fake scenario,
etc.).
154

In addition, EIC Awardees must ensure that their projects are not subject to
national/third country security requirements that could affect implementation or put
into question the award of the grants (e.g. technology restrictions, national security
classification, etc.). Any potential security issues must be notified immediately to  the
Agency.
B.10 Gender Equality Plans and gender mainstreaming
Relevant EIC Awardees  must take all measures to promote equal opportunities
between men and women in implementing the action and, where applicable, in line
with their gender equality plan. They must aim to achieve, to the extent possible, a
gender balance at all levels of pers onnel assigned to the action, including at
supervisory and managerial level.
In addition, to be eligible, legal entities from Member States and Associated Countries
that are public bodies, research organisations or higher education establishments
(including private research organisations and higher education establishments)  must
have a gender equality plan, covering the following minimum process -related
requirements:
 Publication: a formal document published on the institution’s website and
signed by the top management;
 Dedicated resources: commitment of resources and in gender equality to
implement the plan;
 Data collection and monitoring: sex/gender disaggregated data on personnel
(and students, for the establishments concerned) and annual reporting based
on indicators;
 Training: Awareness raising/trainings on gender equality and unconscious
gender biases for staff and decision-makers.
Content-wise, it is recommended that the gender equality plan addresses the following
areas, using concrete measures and targets:
▪ work-life balance and organisational culture;
▪ gender balance in leadership and decision-making;
▪ gender equality in recruitment and career progression;
▪ integration of the gender dimension into research and teaching content;
▪ measures against gender-based violence including sexual harassment.
155

A self -declaration will be requested at proposal stage.  If all the above -mentioned
mandatory requirements are met through another strategic document, such as a
development plan or an inclusion or diversity strategy, it can be considered as an
equivalent. This eligibility criterion does not apply to other categories of legal entities, such
as priva te for -profit organisations, including SMEs, non -governmental or civil society
organisations.
B.11 Financial support to third parties
Where the specific call/topic conditions allow for financial support to third parties, the
applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and the expected
results, including the elements listed in the application template. The following
conditions must also be fulfilled:
 projects must publish their open calls widely and adhere to EU standards of
transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality;
 all calls for third parties and all calls that are implemented by third parties must
be published on the Funding & Tenders Portal, and on the beneficiaries’
websites;
 the calls must remain open for at least 2 months;
 if submission deadlines are changed, this must immediately be announced and
registered applicants must be informed of the change;
 projects must publish the outcome of the calls without delay, including a
description of third-party projects, the date of the award, the duration, and the
legal name of the third party and country of establishment;
 the calls must have a clear European dimension.
Further conditions may be stipulated in the specific conditions for the topic.
For more information, see AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement, Articles
6.2.D.1 and 9.4.
C. FINANCIAL and OPERATIONAL CAPACITY
C.1 Financial capacity
Applicants must have stable and sufficient resources  to successfully implement the
projects and contribute their share. Organisations participating in several projects must
have sufficient capacity to implement all these projects.
The financial capacity check will be done on the basis of the documents that the
applicants will be requested to upload in the Participant Register  during the grant
preparation stage (e.g. profit and loss account and balance sheet, business plan, audit
156

report produced by an approved external auditor, certifying the accounts for the last
closed financial year, etc.). The analysis will be based on neutral financial indicators, but
will also take into account other aspects, such as dependency on EU funding and deficit
and revenue in previous years.
The check will normally be done for the coordinator and if the requested grant amount
is equal or greater than EUR 500 000, except for:
 public bodies (entities established as public body under national law, including
local, regional or national authorities) or international organisations, and
 cases where the individual requested grant amount is not more than EUR 60 000
(low-value grant).
If needed, it may also be done for the other applicants, including affiliated entities. If
the financial capacity is structurally guaranteed by another legal entity, the financial
capacity of that legal entity will be verified.
If the Agency considers that the financial capacity is not satisfactory, they may require:
− further information;
− an enhanced financial responsibility regime, i.e. joint and several responsibility
of affiliated entities (see Section G below); and
− prefinancing paid in instalments;
or
− propose no prefinancing;
− request that the applicant concerned is replaced or, if needed, reject the entire
proposal.
For more information, see Rules on Legal Entity Validation, LEAR Appointment and
Financial Capacity Assessment.
C.2 Operational capacity
Applicants must have the know-how, qualifications  and resources to successfully
implement their tasks in the project and contribute their share (including, when
appropriate, sufficient experience in EU/trans-national projects of comparable size).
This assessment of operational capacity will be carried out during the evaluation of the
award criterion ‘quality and efficiency of the implementation’ . It will be based on the
competence and experience of the applicants and their project teams, including its
157

operational resources (human, technical and other) or, exceptionally, the measures
proposed to obtain the necessary competence and experience by the time of the tasks
are implemented.
If the evaluation of this award criterion leads a score above the applicable threshold,
then the applicants are considered to have sufficient operational capacity.
For this assessment, applicants will be required to provide the following information in
the application form:
− description of the (consortium) participant(s); and
− for each participant:
– identity of researchers involved in the proposal (through the researchers
table);
– up to five most relevant publications, widely -used datasets, software,
goods, services, or any other achievements relevant to the call content;
– up to five most relevant previous projects or activities, connected to the
subject of this proposal; and
– description of any significant infrastructure and/or any major items of
technical equipment, relevant to the proposed work.
Additional supporting documents may be requested if they are needed to confirm the
operational capacity of any applicant.
Public bodies, Member State organisations and international organisations are
exempted from the operational capacity check.
For the EIC Accelerator, the o perational capacity of the applicant will be assessed
during the evaluation of the award criterion ‘Level of risk, implementation, and need
for Union support’. Experts will assess whether each participant has, or will have in due
time thanks to EIC support, sufficient operational capacity to successfully carry out their
tasks in the proposed work -plan. This assessment will be based on the competence
and experience of the applicant,  including their operational resources (human,
technical, other) and the measures proposed to secure these resources by the time of
the implementation of the tasks.
158

C.3 Exclusion
Applicants that are subject to EU administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion)271 or are in
one of the following exclusion situations272 that bar them from receiving EU grants
can NOT participate:
 bankruptcy, winding up, affairs administered by the courts, arrangement with
creditors, suspended business activities or other similar procedures (including
procedures for persons with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
 they are in breach of social security or tax obligations (including if done by
persons with unlimited liability for the applicant’s debts);
 they are guilty of grave professional misconduct (including if done by persons
having powers of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners
or persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant);
 they are guilty of fraud, corruption, having links to a criminal organisation,
money laundering, terrorism -related crimes (including terrorism financing),
child labour or human trafficking (including if done by persons having powers
of representation, decision-making or control, beneficial owners or persons who
are essential for the award/implementation of the grant);
 they have shown significant deficiencies in complying with main obligations
under an EU procurement contract, grant agreement or grant decision
(including if done by persons having powers of representation, decision making
or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for the
award/implementation of the grant);
 they are guilty of irregularities within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation
No 2988/95273 (including if done by persons having powers of representation,
decision making or control, beneficial owners or persons who are essential for
the award/implementation of the grant); or
 they have created under a different jurisdiction an entity with the intent to
circumvent fiscal, social or other legal obligations in the country of origin or
created another entity with this purpose (including if done by persons having
powers of representation, decision making or control, beneficial owners or
persons who are essential for the award/implementation of the grant).

271 Article 138, EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.

Communities financial interests, (OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1).
159

Applicants will also be refused if they:274
 have misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in
the procedure or have failed to supply that information; or
 were previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award
procedure where this entails a breach of the principle of equality of treatment,
including distortion of competition, that cannot be remedied otherwise.

D. AWARD CRITERIA
D.1 Award criteria
If admissible and eligible, the proposals for Coordination and Support Actions will be
evaluated and ranked against the following award criteria:


D.2 Scores and weighting
Evaluation scores will be awarded for the criteria, and not for the different aspects
listed.
For Coordination and Support Actions  full applications, each criterion will be scored
out of 5. The threshold for individual criteria will be 3. The overall threshold, applying
to the sum of the three individual scores, will be 10.
All scores will be given a weight of 1.
Excellence Impact Quality and efficiency of
the implementation
 Clarity and
pertinence of the
project’s objectives.
 Quality of the
proposed
coordination and/or
support measures
including soundness
of methodology.
 Credibility of the
pathways to achieve
the expected
outcomes and
impacts specified in
the Work Programme,
and the likely scale
and significance of
the contributions due
to the project.
 Suitability and quality
of the measures to
maximise expected
outcomes and
impacts, as set out in
the dissemination and
exploitation plan,
including
communication
activities.
  Quality and
effectiveness of the
work plan, assessment
of risks, and
appropriateness of the
effort assigned to work
packages, and the
resources overall.
 Capacity and role of
each participant, and
the extent to which the
consortium as a whole
brings together the
necessary expertise.

161

Proposals that pass the individual threshold AND the overall threshold will be
considered for funding, within the limits of the available call budget. Other proposals
will be rejected.
D.3 Two-stage calls
Where applicable, this is detailed in the main part of this Work Programme, under the
relevant sections.
E. DOCUMENTS
Submission
All proposals must be submitted electronically via the Funders & Tenders Portal
electronic submission system (accessible via the topic page in the Search Funding &
Tenders section). Paper submissions are NOT possible.
Proposals must be complete and contain all parts and mandatory annexes and
supporting documents.
The application form will have two parts:
– Part A (to be filled in directly online) contains administrative information about
the applicant organisations (future coordinator and beneficiaries and affiliated
entities), the summarised budget for the proposal and call-specific questions;
– Part B (to be downloaded from the Portal submission system, completed and
then assembled and re-uploaded as a PDF in the system) contains the technical
description of the project.  For the EIC Accelerator, Part B will consist of the
business plan.
Annexes and supporting documents will be directly available in the submission system
and must be uploaded as PDF files (or other formats allowed by the system).
Proposals should be designed to stay as close as possible to the award criteria (see
Section D above). The application form will help to achieve this.
When submitting the proposal, the coordinator will have to confirm that they have the
mandate to act for all applicants. Moreover, they will have to confirm that the
information in the application is correct and complete and that all participants comply
with the conditions for receiving EU funding (especially eligibility, financial and
operational capacity, exclusion, etc.). Proposals not complying with these requirements
will be rejected. Before signing the grant, each participant will have to confirm this
again by signing a declaration of honour.
162

For lump sum grants proposals, the estimated budget must be described in a detailed
budget table. This will be used as a basis for justifying and/or fixing the lump sum
amount. As the lump sum must be an approximation of the costs actually incurred, the
costs included in this detailed budget table must comply with the basic eligibility
conditions for EU actual cost grants (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, Article 6).
This is particularly important for purchases and subcontracting, which must ensure best
value for money (or, if appropriate, the lowest price) and be free from any conflicts of
interest. If the budget table contains ineligible costs, the grants may be reduced (even
later on during implementation of the project or after they end). Exceptional ly, the
Decision authorising the use of lump sum funding for a specific action might specify
that a detailed budget table is not required.
Applicants may be asked at a later stage for further documents (for legal entity
validation, financial capacity check, bank account validation, etc.).
F. PROCEDURE
F.1 Evaluation procedure and ranking
Proposals will be checked for formal requirements (admissibility and eligibility) and
then evaluated (for each topic separately) for operational capacity and award criteria
(see Annexes C and D above) by an evaluation committee composed of independent
external experts and then ranked according to their quality score.
For lump sum grants proposals, comments on the detailed lump sum budget table will
be provided in the Evaluation Summary Report only for proposals invited to grant
agreement preparation (or placed in the reserve list) and ones rejected (in part) due to
significant overestimation or underestimation of costs.
Exceptionally, where indicated in the specific call/topic conditions , the evaluation
committee may be composed partially or, in the case of ‘Coordination and support
actions’, partially or fully of representatives of EU institutions.
For proposals with the same score within a single budget envelope a method to
establish the priority order  will be determined, taking into consideration the
objectives of the specific topic. In the absence of special arrangements in the specific
call/topic conditions, the following method will apply:
For each group of proposals with the same score, starting with the group achieving the
highest score and continuing in descending order:
1) Proposals that address aspects of the call that have not otherwise been covered
by more highly ranked proposals will be considered to have the highest priority.
163

2) The proposals identified under 1), if any, will themselves be prioritised according
to the scores they have been awarded for ‘Excellence’. When these scores are
equal, priority will be based on scores for ‘Impact’. In the case of ‘Innovation
actions’, prio rity will be given to the score for ‘Impact’, followed by that for
‘Excellence’.
3) If necessary, the gender balance among the researchers with a leading role
named in the researchers table in the proposal, will be used as a factor for
prioritisation.
4) If necessary, any further prioritisation will be based on geographical diversity,
defined as the number of Member States or Associated Countries represented
in the proposal, not otherwise receiving funds from projects higher up the
ranking list (and if equal in number, then by budget).
5) If a distinction still cannot be made, the panel may decide to further prioritise
by considering other factors related to the objectives of the call, or to Horizon
Europe in general. These may include, for example, enhancing the quality of the
project port folio through synergies between projects or, where relevant and
feasible, involving SMEs. These factors will be documented in the panel report.
6) The method described in 1), 2), 3) and 4) will then be applied to the remaining
equally ranked proposals in the group.
At the end of the evaluation, all applicants will be informed of the result in an evaluation
result letter. Successful proposals will be invited to the next stage, ‘grant preparation’;
the other proposals will be put on the reserve list or rejected.
 No commitment to provide funding — Invitation to the grant preparation stage
does NOT constitute a formal commitment to funding. Various legal checks are still
needed before the grant can be awarded, such as legal entity validation, financial
capacity verification, exclusion check, etc.
 Proposals may also receive a Seal of Excellence 275 and/or a Sovereignty (STEP)
Seal 276as explained in the main part of this Work Programme. With prior authorisation
from the applicant, the Agency may share information concerning the proposal and
the evaluation with interested financing authorities, subject to the conclusion of
confidentiality agreements.  In the case of the Sovereignty (STEP) Seal, information

275 https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en.
276 Sovereignty seal - European Commission (europa.eu)

164

about the project will be, upon consent, display in the STEP Portal with the aim of
enhancing the visibility of the project and attract potential investors.
 Budget flexibility — The budgets set out in the calls and topics are indicative. Unless
otherwise stated, final budgets may change following evaluation. The final figures may
change by up to 20% compared to the total budget indicated in each individual pa rt
of the work programme. Changes within these limits will not be considered substantial
within the meaning of Article 110(5) of EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
F.2 Evaluation review procedure
If the consortium believes that the evaluation procedure was flawed, the coordinator
can submit a complaint (following the deadlines and procedures set out in the
evaluation result letter).
Only the procedural aspects of an evaluation may be the subject of a request for an
evaluation review. The evaluation of the merits of a proposal will not be the subject of
an evaluation review.
A request for an evaluation review must relate to a specific proposal and must be
submitted within 30 days after the beneficiary accesses the evaluation results. The
deadlines will be counted from the date of opening/access. The maximum size limit of
the request is 7 000 characters. Notifications of evaluation results which have not been
opened in the Funding & Tenders Portal within 10 days after sending are considered
to have  been accessed and that deadlines will be counted from the date of
opening/access (see also Funding & Tenders Portal Terms and Conditions).
An evaluation review committee will provide an opinion on the procedural aspects of
the evaluation. The evaluation review committee may recommend a re -evaluation of
the proposal, to be carried out primarily by evaluators who were not involved in the
previous evaluation, or a confirmation of the initial evaluation.
F.3 Indicative timetable for evaluation and for signature of the grant agreement
Unless otherwise stated in the specific call/topic conditions, the timing for evaluation
and grant preparation is as follows:
– information on the outcome of the evaluation: around 5 months from the
deadline for submission;
– indicative date for the signing of grant agreements: around 8 months from the
deadline for submission.


165

G. LEGAL AND FINANCIAL SET-UP OF THE GRANT AGREEMENTS
During the grant preparation stage, the applicant will be asked to prepare the grant
agreement, together with the Agency project officer.
This grant agreement will set out the framework for the grant and its terms and
conditions, particularly concerning deliverables, reporting and payments. The
applicable model with the complete text of the provisions is available on the topic
page, together with the other call documentation.
G.1 Starting date & project duration
The project starting date and duration will be fixed in the grant agreement ( see Data
Sheet, point 1 ). Normally, the starting date will be after the grant has been signed. A
starting date before the date the grant is signed (retroactive) can be granted
exceptionally for duly justified reasons, if agreed with the Agency277.
The project duration is provided in months (extensions will be possible only
exceptionally, for duly justified reasons and if the Agency agrees).
G.2 Milestones and deliverables
The milestones and deliverables for each project will be managed through the grant
management system in the Portal and are reflected in Annex 1 of the grant agreement.
The standard deliverables will be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
G.3 Form of grant, funding rate and maximum grant amount
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.)
will be fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 3 and Article 5).
The project budget is provided in EUR. The amount of the grant awarded may be lower
than the amount requested.
For actual cost grants, the grant will be a budget-based, mixed actual cost grant. This
means that it will reimburse ONLY certain types of costs (eligible costs) and ONLY those
costs actually incurred for the project (NOT the budgeted costs).
The costs will be reimbursed at the funding rate fixed in the specific call/topic
conditions and in the grant agreement.
Such grants may NOT produce a profit. If there is a profit (i.e. surplus of revenues + EU
grant over costs), it will be deducted from the final grant amount.

277 Article 196 EU Financial Regulation 2024/2509.
166

Moreover, the final grant amount may be reduced in case of non -compliance (e.g.
improper implementation, breach of obligations, etc.).
The relevant maximum Horizon Europe funding rates are as follows:
– Research and innovation action: 100%
– Innovation action: 70% (except for non -profit legal entities, where a rate of up
to 100% applies)
– Coordination and support action: 100%
– Innovation and market deployment: 70% (except for non -profit legal entities,
where a rate of up to 100% applies)
Other funding rates may be set out in the specific call/topic conditions.
For lump sum and unit grants , the funding rate is already applied as part of the
methodology for fixing the amounts and is therefore not shown in the grant
agreement.
G.4 Budget categories and cost eligibility rules
The budget categories and cost eligibility rules are fixed in the grant agreement (see
Data Sheet, point 3 and Article 6).
Budget categories:
– actual costs (i.e. costs which are real and not estimated or budgeted) for:
– personnel costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below);
– subcontracting costs;
– purchase costs (unless declared as a unit cost; see below); and
– costs of providing financial support to third parties (if provided for in the specific
call conditions);
– units (i.e. an amount per unit) for:
– personnel unit costs;
– personnel costs of SME owners/natural persons not receiving a salary;
– personnel costs calculated by the beneficiaries according to their usual cost
accounting practices (average personnel costs);
167

– costs of internally invoiced goods and services calculated by the beneficiaries
according to their usual cost accounting practices; and
– specific unit costs (if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions; see also
Annex 2a of the grant agreement);
– flat-rate (i.e. costs calculated by applying a percentage fixed in advance to other
types of eligible costs) for:
– indirect costs (25% flat -rate of the total eligible direct costs, excluding eligible
direct costs for subcontracting, financial support to third parties and any unit
costs or lump sums which include indirect costs);
– lump sum (i.e. a global amount deemed to cover all costs of the action or a specific
category of costs, if provided for in the specific call/topic conditions).
Within a grant, different forms of costs can be used.
Costs can also be declared under several EU Synergy grants, if the cumulative funding
under the grants does not exceed 100% of the eligible costs and the contributions
declared to them.
G.5 Reporting & payment arrangements
The reporting and payment arrangements are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet,
point 4 and articles 21 and 22).
After the grant has been signed, the consortium will normally receive a float to start
working on the project (normally, pre-financing of 160% of the average EU funding per
reporting period (i.e. maximum grant amount/number of periods); exceptionally, less
or no pre -financing). For actions with only one reporting period, it will be less, since
100% would mean the totality of the grant amount.
Payments will be automatically lowered if one of the consortium members has
outstanding debts towards the EU (granting authority or other EU bodies). Such debts
will be offset by the Agency, in line with the conditions set out in the grant agreement
(Article 22).
At the moment of the prefinancing payment, an amount ranging from 5% to 8% of the
maximum grant amount will  be deducted from the prefinancing payment and
transferred to the mutual insurance mechanism. This mechanism covers the risks
associated with non-recovery of sums due from the beneficiaries.
There will be one or several interim payments linked to a periodic report, depending
on the duration of the project.
168

At the end of the project, the consortium will be invited to submit a report on the basis
of which the final grant amount will be calculated. If the total of earlier payments is
higher than the final grant amount, the beneficiaries concerned (or the coordi nator)
will be asked to pay back the difference (recovery).
G.6 Certificates
Depending on the size of the grant amount and on the type of beneficiaries,
beneficiaries may be required to submit a certificate on the financial statements. The
thresholds for this certificate are fixed in the grant agreement (Data Sheet, point 4 and
Article 24).
G.7 Liability regime for recoveries
The liability regime for recoveries is that of individual financial responsibility. Each
beneficiary is liable only for their own debt (and those of its affiliated entities, if any)
(Data Sheet point 4.4 and Article 22).
G.8 Open Science and Data Management
For the EIC Pathfinder and Transition, the EIC funded projects must comply with the
open science requirements as described in the Model Grant Agreement (article 17).
This concern:
 providing immediate open access to scientific publications under the conditions
required by the grant agreement;
 managing responsibly research data generated or reused by projects in line with
the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data)’.
Producing and updating a data management plan; providing open access to
research data under the pr inciple ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’,
that is with exceptions, under the conditions required by the grant agreement;
 providing information about the research outputs/tools/instruments needed to
validate the conclusions of scientific publications or to validate/re-use research
data;
 providing digital or physical access to the results needed to validate the
conclusions of scientific publications, unless exceptions apply (the same as with
open access to research data);
 in cases of public emergency, if requested by the granting authority, providing
immediate open access to all research outputs under open licenses or, if
exceptions apply, access under fair and reasonable conditions to legal entities
that need the research outputs to address the public emergency.
169

Further, open science practices that are not mandatory but recommended, may be
included in projects at the design phase, such as involving all relevant knowledge
actors, including citizens, early and open sharing of research, output management
beyond research data, open peer-review. This is a non-exhaustive list of practices that
proposers are expected to adopt when possible and appropriate for their projects.
Recommended open science practices are incentivised through their evaluation at the
proposal stage . Proposers should be aware of both mandatory and recommended
practices and integrate them into their proposals.
Data Management
All EIC funded projects must develop and update a data management plan in case they
generate or reuse research data or any other research outputs (except for publications).
All personal and non-personal data must be managed responsibly in line with the FAIR
principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data), the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) 278 and the respective European, international and
national legal frameworks. Personal data must not be made public unless explicitly
agreed by the data subjects. Non-personal data will be open in principle but exceptions
to open access apply (following the p rinciple “as open as possible, as closed as
necessary”).
G.9 Provisions concerning project implementation
– Proper implementation of the action (Article 11).
– Conflict of interest (Article 12).
– Confidentiality and security (EU classified information) (Article 13, Annex 5).
– Ethics (research integrity) and values (gender mainstreaming) (Article 14, Annex 5).
– Data protection (Article 15).
– Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights
of use (Article 16 and Annex 5).
In addition to the standard provisions, the following specific provisions in the model
grant agreement will apply to all grants awarded under this work programme:
– Additional exploitation obligations in case of a public emergency:  If
requested by the Agency, beneficiaries must grant non -exclusive licences to
their results – for a limited period of time specified in the request and on fair


170

and reasonable conditions – to legal entities that need the results to address the
public emergency. These legal entities must commit to rapidly and broadly
exploiting the resulting products and services on fair and reasonable conditions.
This provision will apply up to 4 years after the end of the action.
– Additional information obligation relating to standards:  Unless stated
otherwise in the specific call conditions, beneficiaries must, up to 4 years after
the end of the action, inform the Agency if the results could reasonably be
expected to contribute to European or international standards.

Annex 3 Fast Track scheme to apply for the EIC Accelerator
The ‘Fast Track’ scheme is a specific process applicable to the EIC Accelerator. It
provides for a specific treatment of proposals that result from existing Horizon Europe
or Horizon 2020 projects.
Under the Fast Track scheme, applicants do not apply directly to the EIC Accelerator
call (Section IV). Instead, a project review is carried out by the responsible  granting
authority or national funding body  to assess the innovation or market deployment
potential of an existing project, and to decide whether the project is suitable for
support under the EIC Accelerator.
The project review – implemented by the granting authority or national funding body
responsible for the programme – must be conducted using:
 award criteria equivalent to the ones set out for the short application stage of
the EIC Accelerator regarding excellence and impact (Section IV), centred on the
underlying idea of that potential new action;
 a project review  process that guarantees an independent assessment  and is
carried out within the previous two years in compliance with Article 48 of the
Horizon Europe Regulation.
The responsible granting authority or national funding body can submit the outcome
of the projects review to the EIC Accelerator, if the project review concludes that the
following conditions are met:
 the proposal meets the first two criteria of the EIC Accelerator ( i.e. excellence
and impact);
 there is no duplication of funding of activities to be supported under the EIC
Accelerator with the existing grant; and
 the applicant meets the eligibility criteria for the EIC Accelerator.
 Fast Track applicants will then be invited to prepare a full proposal for the EIC
Accelerator following the notification about the successful result of the initial review.
The Fast track Accelerator applicants will be submitted to the same submission
limitations that apply to the EIC Accelerator.
They will receive coaching as specified in Section IV.
Full proposals to the EIC Accelerator stemming from the Fast Track scheme will b e
assessed as set out in Section IV, and will be treated in exactly the same way as all other
full proposals.
172

In 2025, the national funding bodies, schemes, projects and beneficiaries which are
eligible for the Fast Track for EIC Accelerator cut-off dates are:
 The EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition projects (including under EIC pilot)
managed by the Agency;
 Relevant schemes managed by t he Knowledge and Innovation Communities
(KICs) supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) ,
as identified as relevant by each KIC;
 Funding schemes for SMEs supported under the Eurostars -2 Joint Programme
and the Partnership on Innovative SMEs managed by the Eureka secretariat and
relevant national bodies;
 Companies awarded a grant only under the Horizon 2020 EIC pilot Accelerator
and the Horizon Europe EIC Accelerator managed by the Agency.280
 Companies awarded grants under the Pre-accelerator funding scheme;
 Companies awarded grants under the Women Tech.EU scheme.
These national funding bodies are responsible for implementing the Fast Track scheme
in accordance with the above provisions. They may decide not to implement the
scheme or to introduce it at a later stage.
Subject to experience with the Fast Track scheme, the scheme may be opened to other
parts of Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020, and to the funding bodies responsible for
their implementation.
The EIC website will provide up to date information about how the Fast Track scheme
is being implemented by the relevant funding bodies.


280 For previous beneficiaries of a grant, the Fast Track scheme cannot be used to request grant-only support.
173

Annex 4 Pilot Plug-in scheme to apply for the EIC Accelerator
The pilot Plug-in scheme is a specific process applicable to the EIC Accelerator only. Its
process is equivalent to the Fast Track, as described under Annex 3. However, the Plug-
in scheme  applies to proposals that result from existing national or regional
programmes.
Under the Plug-in scheme, applicants do not apply directly to the EIC Accelerator call
(Section IV). Instead, a project review is carried out by the certified national or regional
programme to assess the innovation or market deployment potential of an existing
project supported by the programme, and to decide whether the project is suitable for
support under the EIC Accelerator.
The project review - implemented by the funding/managing body responsible for the
programme or by other appointed authority under the responsibility of the funding
body - must be conducted using:
 award criteria equivalent to the ones set out for the short application stage  of
the EIC Accelerator (Section IV), centred on the underlying idea of that potential
new action;
 equivalent evaluation processes that guarantee an independent assessment of
proposals in compliance with Article 48 of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
The responsible funding/managing body , or other appointed authority under the
responsibility of the funding body, can submit the outcome of the project review to
the EIC Accelerator, if the project review concludes that the following conditions are
met:
 the proposal meets the first two criteria of the EIC Accelerator ( i.e. excellence
and impact);
 there is no duplication of funding of activities to be supported under the EIC
Accelerator with the existing grant allocated at national or regional level; and
 the applicant meets the eligibility criteria for the EIC Accelerator.
 Applicants will then be invited to prepare a full proposal for the EIC Accelerator on the
same basis as applicants passing Step 1 of the EIC Accelerator calls.
The EIC Plug In Accelerator applicants will be submitted to the same submission
limitations that apply to the EIC accelerator. They will receive support through coaching
as specified in Section IV.
174

Full proposals to the EIC Accelerator stemming from the Plug -in scheme will be
assessed as set out in Section IV (above) and will be treated exactly the same way as all
other full proposals.
The Commission certif ies the programmes that are deemed suitable for the Plug -in
scheme based on independent experts’ assessment. The experts will collaborate with
the EIC Plug-in contact points (representatives of Member States and Associated
Countries) who will have to provide accurate information regarding the programmes.
Only programmes for which all the key elements and information are provided by the
EIC Plug-in contact points will be considered for the certification.
A first set of programmes have been certified to be compliant with the requirements
of the Plug-in scheme for a pilot phase. Subject to the outcome of a review of this pilot,
further programmes may be assessed during 2025 and may also be certified to be
compliant with the Plug -in scheme. A full list of certified programmes for the Plug -in
scheme is available on the EIC website.
The Commission services281 will be notified if any future changes in the criteria and/or
evaluation of the regional or national programmes may impact the assessment and
certification of those programmes.
The Commission may withdraw the certification, if it finds out that:
 false information was used to obtain the certification;
 the project review did not comply with the provisions as set out in the EIC work
programme.
The funding/managing bodies in charge of these national/regional programmes, or
other appointed authority under the responsibility of the funding body, are responsible
for implementing the Plug -in scheme in accordance with the above provisions. They
may de cide not to implement the scheme or to introduce it at a later stage. A
coordination among the different national and regional funding bodies will have to be
ensured at national level to avoid duplication of the proposals.
After the certification process is concluded, the responsible funding/managing bodies,
or other appointed authorities under the responsibility of the funding body, are entitled
to present the projects that have passed the project review and were funded under
those certified programmes. In the pilot phase, a limitation for the number of projects
proposed by each programme and each Member State or Associated Country will be
agreed.

281 From the Directorate General in charge and/or Executive Agency to which the tasks/programme will be
delegated.

Annex 6 Additional provisions concerning Intellectual Property for
EIC Pathfinder and EIC Transition
In accordance with the Horizon Europe Regulation, 284 the current Work Programme
provides for additional dissemination and exploitation obligations  in particular to
facilitate the exploitation of results, and to enable a more pro -active role to the
Commission and EISMEA identifying and maximising exploitation opportunities in the
Union.
Together with specific intellectual property rules provided for under annex 5 of the
Model Grant agreement, the  following rules will apply to EIC Pathfinder and EIC
Transition actions.
1. Definitions
The following definition is complementing those provided in the Glossary in the
introductory section of this Work Programme for the purpose of this Annex.
With reference to information and results owned by any EIC Awardee that is a not-for-
profit legal entity, EIC Inventors are any of their employees and subcontractors,
established in a Member States or Associated Country, and appearing or entitled to
appear as inventor in any corresponding patent filing  and according to the definition
of inventor for the relevant patent jurisdiction.
2. Exchange of information for the purpose of EIC portfolio activities
2.1 – Access to information about results285
a. At any time and without prejudice to the EIC Awardee’s ownership of results the
EIC Programme Manager may request any EIC Awardee to facilitate information on
results (preliminary or final) generated by the action, subject to paragraphs b) and
c) below, with the aim to probe their potential for further innovation.
b. Where any such result (preliminary or final) was not already made public through
agreed dissemination activities or a patent or protection by any other intellectual
property right, that information shall be earmarked and treated by the Agency  as
confidential and disseminated only to:

284 In accordance with Recital (85) and notably the second indent of Article 39(1) of Horizon Europe Regulation.
285 Results’ means any tangible or intangible effect of the action, such as data, know-how or information, whatever
its form or nature, whether or not it can be protected, as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual
property rights.
179

 other EIC Awardees, bound by an EIC grant agreement or an EIC contract, that
refers to or includes the obligations detailed under section 2.2 below;
 EIC inventors having signed a non -disclosure agreement with the Agency,
providing for the obligations detailed under section 2.2 below;
 other member of the EIC Community platform established in a Member State
or an Associated Country and having signed a non-disclosure agreement with
the Agency, providing for the obligations detailed under section 2.2.
Where based on that confidential information any of above mentioned entities
request disclosure or access to the underlying detailed data and results, the EIC
Awardee may refuse it based on its legitimate interests, including commercial
exploitation and any other constraints, such as data protection rules, privacy,
confidentiality, trade secrets, Union competitive interests, security rules or
intellectual property rights.
c. EIC Awardees may object to the obligation provided for under paragraph b) when:
 committing to either publish or patent or protect by any other intellectual
property right and without unreasonable delays, or
 demonstrating concrete exploitation of the said preliminary findings and
results, subject to initial discussion with and final agreement of the Agency
on the corresponding update of the Plan for dissemination and exploitation
referred to in Section 3.1.
2.2 – Non-disclosure obligations
Where EIC Awardees are informed on or given access or disclosure to any preliminary
findings, results or other intellectual property generated by other EIC actions, and
where this information is earmarked as confidential  in accordance with section 2.1.b,
they must:
  keep it strictly confidential; and
 not disclose it to any person without the prior written consent of the owner, and
then only under conditions of confidentiality equal to those provided under this
section; and
 use the same degree of care to protect its confidentiality as the EIC awardee
uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature; and
 act in good faith at all times; and
180

 not use any of it for any purpose other than assessing opportunities to propose
other research or innovation activities to the EIC, or any other initiative agreed
by the owner.
These EIC Awardees may disclose any such information to their employees and, with
the prior authorisation of the owner, to their subcontractors established in a Member
State or an Associated Country if these subcontractors:
 need to access it for the performance of their work with respect to the purpose
permitted as above; and
 are bound by a written agreement or professional obligation to protect its
confidentiality in the way described in this section.
No obligations are imposed upon the EIC Awardee where such information:
 is already known to the EIC awardee before and is not subject to any other
obligation of confidentiality; or
 is or becomes publicly known through no act by or default by/of the EIC
awardee; or
 is obtained by the EIC awardee from a third party and in circumstances where
the EIC awardee has no reason to believe that there has been a breach of an
obligation of confidentiality.
The restrictions in this section do not apply if such information is required to be
disclosed by any law or regulation, by any judicial or governmental order or request,
or pursuant to disclosure requirements relating to the listing of the stock of the EIC
awardee on any recognised stock exchange.
Upon the end or termination of the grant agreement or of the participation of the EIC
awardee, it must immediately cease to use the said information, except if otherwise
directly agreed with the owner, or if the EIC awardee remains a member of the EIC
Community referred to under section 2.1.b.
The provisions of this section will be in force for a period of 60 months following the
end or the termination of the grant agreement or of the participation of the EIC
awardee, at the end of which period they will cease to have effect.
181

3. Specific provisions on intellectual property and related dissemination and
exploitation activities
3.1 – Plan for exploitation and dissemination
EIC Awardees must report to the Agency on their exploitation and dissemination
activities:
 in accordance with the grant agreement, together with any updated version of
the plan for exploitation and dissemination;
 within 30 days upon request from the EIC Programme Manager for the purpose
of EIC portfolio activities.
The Agency may also request an update of the plan for exploitation and dissemination
of the results at any time during the implementation of the action.
EIC Awardees must address and agree in their Consortium agreement on all related
intellectual property issues, from ownership and co -ownership of results to the
consortium’s internal approval process for their dissemination. EIC Awardees must also
identify therein any pre -existing technology fitting the action’s needs and objectives
and try to reach appropriate licensing agreement between them to prevent research
funding redundancy.
The EIC Awardees are deemed to have signed the Consortium agreement at the date
of the signature of this grant agreement.  The Agency may require a copy at any time
in accordance with the grant agreement.
3.2 – Dissemination activities
Each EIC awardee will propose and undertake dissemination activities of the plan for
exploitation and dissemination agreed by the Agency with the aim of supporting
innovation in the European Union and fostering the development of the EIC
Community, opting for publications as main route to bring technical and scientific
knowledge to the public.
When approving the plan for exploitation and dissemination of the results or any
update, the Agency may subject any proposed dissemination activity to one or a
combination of the following conditions:
 the prior assessment of any innovation potential of the results to be
disseminated,
 the prior protection of the result to be disseminated, in accordance with the
grant agreement, the cost being eligible;
182

Where the Agency disagrees to a dissemination activity, it will actively assist the EIC
Awardees to achieve compliance  with the required conditions, without unreasonable
delay and in due time, notably by proposing  complementary EIC support for
exploitation or a support of the Business Acceleration Services, as detailed and referred
to under section V.I. Where the Agency agrees to a dissemination activity, it will abide
to the grant agreement.
The Agency is hereby entrusted with the right to also disseminate and promote the
exploitation of any results that are made public by the EIC awardee or with its assent.
3.3 – Exploitation of results
EIC Awardees must use their best efforts to exploit their results or have them exploited
by a third party, in priority those established in a Member State or an Associated
Country, including through transfer or licensing.  The Agency may object to a transfer
of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results under certain conditions as detailed
in the EIC grant agreement.
EIC Awardees must report on any exploitation operation :
 at the reporting periods provided for in the grant agreement;
 with the periodicity agreed at the end of the action together with the final
exploitation and dissemination plan;
 within 30 days upon request from the Agency, within 4 years after final payment.
Each EIC Awardee agrees upon signature of the grant agreement, to ensure the
necessary support or access rights for the further development and exploitation of
results that any of its EIC Inventors have contributed to (respecting the transfer rule).
If the EIC Awardee provides financial or other support to the EIC Inventor for any such
exploitation, royalties or other returns may be shared with the EIC Awardee on mutually
beneficial terms, provided the conclusion of any such agreement does not prevent the
EIC Inventor(s) to exercise their rights. Such financial support should  include as a
minimum the full or partial funding of the costs of relevant Intellectual Property Right
protection in major jurisdictions. Other support includes expertise, access to
infrastructure and facilities, or other forms of support. The royalties and other returns
to the EIC Awardee should be fair and proportionate to the financial and other support
provided.
If the EIC Awardee does not commit to provide support within a maximum period of 6
months from the date of the first formal request from the EIC Inventor, or that support
is manifestly inadequate, then the EIC Awardee must entrust sufficient access rights to
183

allow the EIC Inventor to further develop and exploit the result. If the EIC Awardee does
not provide support for exploitation, then by default the access rights to the EIC
Inventor are royalty free.
The EIC Inventor must inform the EIC Awardee in due time before any exploitation
activity they intend to undertake, and report to the EIC Awardee on the implementation
of the exploitation activity.
If the EIC Awardee considers that the exploitation activity could negatively affect its
own exploitation activities:
 In the absence of any approved exploitation and dissemination plan, the EIC
Awardee may request to the Agency the suspension of the access rights of a
given EIC Inventor, by demonstrating that their use puts negatively at stake their
future strategy of or ongoing valorisation activities.
 Where an exploitation and dissemination plan has been approved, the EIC
Awardee may directly suspend the access rights of a given EIC Inventor if this
would negatively affect the implementation of the said approved plan. The EIC
Inventor may request the Agency to lift that suspension by demonstrating that
the exercise of the access rights does not affect the said plan.

3.4 – Failure to exploit or disseminate
The Agency is entrusted with the right to disseminate and promote the exploitation of
results that have not been made public through dissemination activities or patent or
protection by any other IPR, where the EIC awardee owning it:
 does not provide any information regarding exploitation or dissemination of
those results; or
 neither intends to exploit nor disseminate those results; or
 declares to continue research activities on those results but without a view of
their subsequent exploitation; or
 where, despite its best efforts, no exploitation or dissemination takes place
within the delays provided in the final exploitation and dissemination plan set
out in the grant agreement and in the absence of any demonstrated alternative
exploitation or dissemination opportunity.
Where the EIC awardee continues to oppose to the dissemination by the Agency or
refuses to provide any data or document necessary for the said dissemination, the
Agency may impose penalties in accordance with the grant agreement.
