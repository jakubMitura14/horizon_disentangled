Structure of the Proposal

The proposal contains two parts:

• Part A  of the proposal is generated by the IT system. It is based on the information entered by the participants
through the submission system in the Funding & Tenders Portal.  The participants can update the information in the
submission system at any time before final submission.

• Part B of the proposal is the narrative part that includes three sections that each correspond to an evaluation criterion. Part
B needs to be uploaded as a PDF document following the templates downloaded by the applicants in the submission system
for the specific call or topic. The templates for a specific call may slightly differ from the example provided in this document.

The electronic submission system is an online wizard that guides you step -by-step through the preparation of your proposal.
The submission process consists of 6 steps:

- Step 1: Logging in the Portal
- Step 2: Select the call, topic and type of action in the Portal
- Step 3: Create a draft proposal: Title, acronym, summary, main organisation and contact details
- Step 4: Manage your parties and contact details: add your partner organisations and contact details.
- Step 5: Edit and complete web forms for proposal part A and upload proposal part B
- Step 6: Submit the proposal

Proposal template Part B: technical description

The structure of this template must be followed when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that
the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective
assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion.
Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were submitted, rather than on their potential if certain
changes were to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required aspects will
have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and
consortium composition during grant preparation.
 Page limit: The sections 1, 2 and 3, together, should not be longer than 30 pages. All tables, figures, references
and any other element pertaining to these sections must be included as an integral part of these sections and are thus
counted against this page limit.
The page limit will be applied automatically; therefore,  you must remove this instruction page before submitting.
Remove also the table with the definition of terms and the help text added after each section.
If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit before the deadline, you will receive an
automatic warning and will be advised to shorten and re -upload the proposal. After the deadline, excess pages (in
over-long proposals/applications) will be automatically made invisible and will not be taken into consideration by
the experts. The proposal is a self -contained document.  Experts will be instructed to ignore hyperlinks to
information that is specifically designed to expand the proposal, thus circumventing the page limit.
Please, do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since
experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light.
The page limit will be applied automatically. At the end of this document you can see the structure of the
actual proposal that you need to submit, please remove all instruction pages that are watermarked.
 The following formatting conditions apply.
The reference font for the body text of proposals is Times New Roman (Windows platforms), Times/Times New
Roman (Apple platforms) or Nimbus Roman No. 9 L (Linux distributions).
The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and is subject to the cumulative conditions that the font
is legible and that its use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal in number of pages
compared to using the reference font (for example with a view to bypass the page limit).
The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. Standard character spacing and a minimum of single line spacing is to
be used. This applies to the body text, including text in tables.
Text elements other than the body text, such as headers, foot/end notes, captions, formula's, may deviate, but must
be legible.
The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or
headers).
This document is tagged. Do not delete the tags; they are needed for our internal processing of information, mostly
for statistical gathering. In that light, please do not move, delete, re -order, alter tags in any way, as they might
create problems in our internal processing tools. Tags do not affect or influence the outcome of your application.

DEFINITIONS
Critical risk A critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact on the ability of
the project to achieve its objectives.
Level of likelihood to occur (Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that
the risk will materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.
Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and the significance of
its effect.
Deliverable A report that is sent to the Commission or Agency provi ding information to ensure effective
monitoring of the project. There are different types of deliverables (e.g. a report on specific
activities or results, data management plans, ethics or security requirements).
Impacts Wider long term  effects on society (including the environment), the economy and science,
enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments  (long term). Impacts generally occur some time
after the end of the project.
Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting system enables each airport to increase
maximum passenger capacity by 15% and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a
28% reduction in infrastructure expansion costs.
Milestone Control points in the pro ject that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the
achievement of a key result , allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be
needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be
taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the
consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development . The
achievement of a milestone should be verifiable.
Objectives The goals of the work performed within the project , in terms of its research and innovation
content. This will be translated into the project’s results. These may range from tackling specific
research questions, demonstrating the feasibility of an innovation, shari ng knowledge among
stakeholders on specific issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action,
and the scope of the topic.
Outcomes The expected e ffects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a given topic.  The
results of  a project should contribute to these outcomes, fostered in particular by the
dissemination and exploitation measures. This may include the uptake, diffusion, deployment,
and/or use of the project’s results by direct target groups . Outcomes generally occur during or
shortly after the end of the project.
Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system demonstrated during the
project.
Pathway to
impact
Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project over time , in
particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with t he projects’ results, to their
dissemination, exploitation and communica tion, contributing to the expected outcomes in  the
work programme topic, and ultimately to the  wider scientific, economic and societal impacts  of
the work programme destination.
Research
output
Results generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of scientific
publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms,
protocols and electronic notebooks.

Results What is generated during the project implementation . Th is may include, for example, know-
how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility , new business models, policy
recommendations, guidelines,  prototypes, demonstrators , databases and datasets, trained
researchers, new infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, s cientific
works, etc.) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by formal
‘Intellectual Property Rights’.
Example: Successful large-scale demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting
system for proactive airport passenger flow management.

Guidance on the use of generative AI tools for the preparation of the proposal
When considering the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the preparation of the proposal, it is
imperative to exercise caution and careful consideration. The AI-generated content should be thoroughly
reviewed and validated by the applicants to ensure its appropriateness and accuracy, as well as its compliance
with intellectual property regulations. Applicants are fully responsible for the content of the proposal (even those
parts produced by the AI tool) and must be transparent in disclosing which AI tools were used and how they were
utilized.
Specifically, applicants are required to:
• Verify the accuracy, validity, and appropriateness of the content and any citations generated by the AI
tool and correct any errors or inconsistencies.
• Provide a list of sources used to generate content and citations, including those generated by the AI tool.
Double-check citations to ensure they are accurate and properly referenced.
• Be conscious of the potential for plagiarism where the AI tool may have reproduced substantial text from
other sources. Check the original sources to be sure you are not plagiarizing someone else’s work.

Part B - Page 7 of 21
• Describe and explain the overall methodology including the concepts, models and assumptions that
underpin your work. Explain how this will enable you to deliver your project’s objectives. Refer to the
high-risk issues you may have identified in the chosen methodology and how you intend to address them.

• Explain how this methodology will enable reaching the objectives within the time span of the project.
 This section should be presented as a narrative. The detailed tasks and work packages, and the risks
and the corresponding mitigation plan are described below under ‘Implementation’.
 Where relevant, include how the project methodology complies with the ‘do no significant harm’
principle as per Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 2020/852 o n the establishment of a framework to
facilitate sustainable investment  (i.e. the so -called 'EU Taxonomy Regulation'). This means that the
methodology is designed in a way it is not significantly harming any of the six environmental
objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.

 If you plan to use, develop and/or deploy artificial intelligence (AI) based systems and/or techniques
you must demonstrate their technical robustness. AI -based systems or techniques should be, or be
developed to become:
• technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform about
possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed risk they pose
• socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which th ey
operate
• reliable and function as intended, minimizing unintentional and unexpected harm,
preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental integrity of
humans
• able to provide a suitable explanation of their decision-making processes, whenever they
can have a significant impact on people’s lives.
• E
xplain how expertise and methods from different disciplines will be brought together and integrated in
pursuit of your objectives. If you consider that an inter-disciplinary approach is unnecessary in the context
of the proposed work, please provide a justification.
• D escribe how the gender dimension (i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s
research and innovation content . If you do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in your
project, please provide a justification.
 Note: This section is mandatory except for topics which have been identified in the work
programme as not requiring the integration of the gender dimension into R&I content.
 Remember that that this question relates to the content of the planned research and innovation
activities, and not to gender balance in the teams in charge of carrying out the project.
 Sex and gender analysis refers to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively.
For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please
refer to https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/gendered- innovations-2-2020-nov-24_en
• Describe how appropriate o pen s cience practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed
methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementation are adapted to the nature of
your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives . If you believe
that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justification here.

Part B - Page 8 of 21
 Open s cience is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of
knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. Open science practices include
early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre -
prints, or crowd -sourcing); research output management; measures to ensure reproducibility of
research outputs; providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software,
models, algorithms, and workflows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant
knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co -creation of R&I agendas
and contents (such as citizen science).
 Please note that this question does not refer to outreach actions that may be planned as part of
communication, disseminat ion and exploitation activities . These aspects should instead be
described below under ‘Impact’.
• Re search  data management and management of other research outputs: Applicants
generating/collecting data and/or other research outputs (except for publications) during the project
must provide how the data/ research outputs will be managed in line with the FAIR principles (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), addressing the following (the description should be specific to your
project):
Types of data/research outputs (e.g. experimental, observational, images, text, numerical) and their
estimated size; if applicable, combination with, and provenance of, existing data.
Findability of data/ research outputs:  Types of persistent and unique identifiers (e.g.  digital object
identifiers) and trusted repositories that will be used.
Accessibility of data/research outputs:  IPR considerations and timeline for open access (if open
access not provided, explain why); provisions for access to restricted data for verification purposes.
Interoperability of data/research outputs:  Standards, formats and vocabularies for data and
metadata.
Reusability of data/research outputs:  Licenses for data sharing and re-use (e.g. Creative Commons,
Open Data Commons);  availability of tools/software/models for data generation and
validation/interpretation /re-use.
Curation and storage/preservation costs ; person/team responsible for data management and
quality assurance.
 Proposals selected for funding  under Horizon Europe will need to develop a  detailed data
management plan (DMP) for making their data/research outputs  findable, accessible,
interoperable and reusable (FAIR) as a deliverable by month 6 and revised towards the end of a
project’s lifetime.
 For guidance on open science practices and research data management, please refer to the
relevant section of the HE Programme Guide o
n the Funding & Tenders Portal.

Part B - Page 9 of 21
Impact – aspects to be taken into account.
− Potential Impact: How credible are the pathways to achieve the expected outcomes and
impacts of the Challenge? To what extent would the successful completion of the
project contribute to this?
− Innovation potential : How adequate are the proposed measures for protection of
results and any other exploitation measures to facilitate future translation of research
results into innovations with positive societal, economic or enviro nmental impact? How
suitable are the proposed measures for involving and empowering key actors that have
the potential to take the lead in translating research into innovations in the future?
− Communication and Dissemination: How suitable are the proposed m easures, including
communication activities, to maximise expected outcomes and impacts for raising
awareness about the project results’ potential to establish new markets and/or address
global challenges?
In this section you should show how your project could contribute to the impacts described in the Work
Programme and in the Challenge Guide, the likely scale and significance of this contribution, and the measures to
maximise these impacts. Such measures r efer to exploitation, communication and dissemination measures. Some
of those can be in the form of Portfolio activities to be carried out w ith the other projects of the portfolio and the
EIC Programme Manager (see also the Challenge Guide for envisaged portfolio objectives and activities, if
applicable).
2.1. Potential impact
• Provide a narrative  explaining how the project ’s results are  expected to make a difference  in terms of
impact, beyond the immediate scope and duration of the project. The narrative should include the
components below, tailored to your project.
(a) Describe the unique contribution your project results would make towards (1) the outcomes specified
for this Challenge, and (2) the wider impacts, in the longer term, specified in the Work Programme
and in the Challenge Guide.
 Be specific, referring to the effects of your project, and not R&I in general in this field.
 State the target groups that would benefit. Even if  target groups are mentioned in general terms
in the work programme, you should be specific here, breaking target groups into particular
interest groups or segments of society relevant to this project.
 The outcomes and impacts of your project may be:
• Scientific, e.g. contributing to specific scientific advances, across and within disciplines,
creating new knowledge, reinforcing scientific equipment and instruments,  computing
systems (i.e. research infrastructures);
• Economic/technological, e.g. bringing new products, services, business processes to the
market, increasing efficiency, decreasing costs, increasing profits, contributing to
standards’ setting,  etc.
• Societal , e.g. decreasing CO
2 emissions, decreasing avoidable mortality, improving policies
and decision making, raising consumer awareness.
Only include such outcomes and impacts where your project would make a significant and direct
contribution. Avoid describing very tenuous links to wider impacts.  However, include any potential
Example, not to be completedCall: [insert call identifier] — [insert call name]
EU Grants: Application form (HE EIC Pathfinder Challenges): V3.4 – 12.06.2024


Part B - Page 10 of 21
negative environmental outcome or impact of the project including when expected results are
brought at scale (such as at commercial level). Where relevant, explain how the potential harm
can be managed.
(b) Give an indication of the scale and significance of the project’s contribution to the expected outcomes
and impacts, should the project be successful.  Provide quantified estimates where possible and
meaningful.
 ‘Scale’ refers to how widespread the  outcomes and impacts are likely to be. For example, in terms
of the size of the target group, or the  proportion of that group, that should benefit over time;
‘Significance’ refers to the importance, or value, of those benefits. For example, number of
additional healthy life years; efficiency savings in energy supply.
 Explain your baselines, benchmarks and assumptions used for those estimates.  Wherever possible,
quantify your estimation of the effects that you expect from your project. Explain assumptions that
you make, referring for example to any relevant studies or statistics. Where appropriate, try to use
only one methodology for calculating your estimates : not different methodologies for each
partner, region or country (the extrapolation should preferably be prepared by one partner).
 Your estimate must relate to this project only - the effect of other initiatives should not be taken
into account.
(c) Describe any requirements and potential barriers - arising from factors beyond the scope and
duration of the project  - that may determine whether the desired outcomes and impacts are
achieved. These may include, for example, other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe;
regulatory environment; targeted markets; user behaviour. Indicate if these factors might evolve over
time. Describe any  mitigating measures you propose, within or beyond your project, that could be
needed should your assumptions prove to be wrong, or to address identified barriers.
 Note that this does not include the critical risks inherent to the managemen t of the pro ject itself ,
which should be described below under ‘Implementation’.
2.2 Innovation potential
• Describe the exploitation measures to facilitate future translation of research results into innovations.
  Shortly describe the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the innovations.
 Beneficiaries must use their best efforts to exploit their results or have them exploited by a third
party, in priority those established in a Member State or an Associated country, including through
transfer or licensing.
 If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by explaining how
that exploitation is still in the Union’s interest.
• Specify your strategy for the management of intellec tual property, foreseen protection measures, such as
patents, design rights, copyright, trade secrets, etc. How adequate are they to support exploitation?
 Clear description of necessary measures to allow future uptake, for instance through an adequate
form of protection of the generated Intellectual Property (IP) and an assessment of relevant
aspects related to regulation, certification, and standardization is expected.
 If your project is selected for funding, you will need an appropriate consortium agreement to
manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, research data
Example, not to be completedCall: [insert call identifier] — [insert call name]
EU Grants: Application form (HE EIC Pathfinder Challenges): V3.4 – 12.06.2024


Part B - Page 11 of 21
etc.). Where relevant, these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market
opportunities arising from the project.
 If your project is selected, you must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in
the final periodic report.
Explain the measures the consortium will implement for involving and empowering key actors (such as excellent
early-career researchers or promising hig h-tech SMEs, including start-ups) that have the potential to take
the lead in translating research into innovations.
2.3 Communication and Dissemination
#@COM-DIS-VIS-CDV@#
• Describe the foreseen measures and plans for stakeholder and general public enga gement and for raising
awareness about the project’s outcomes, with respect to their potential to establish new markets and/or
address global challenges.
 Project results should include top-level scientific publications in Open Access.
 Communication1 measures should promote  the project throughout the full lifespan of the project .
The aim is to inform and reach out to society and show the activities performed, and the use and
the benefits the project will have for citizens. Activities must be strategically planned, with clear
objectives, start at the outset and continue through the lifetime of the project . The description of
the communication activities needs to state the main messages as well as the tools and channels
that will be used to reach out to each of the chosen target groups.
 All measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and should contain concrete
actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project . In the justification, explain
why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group addressed.
 In case your proposal is selected for funding, a more detailed ‘plan f or d issemination and
exploitation including communication activities’ will need to be provided as a mandatory project
deliverable within 6 months after the start of the project. This plan shall be periodically updated in
alignment with the project’s progress.
 Describe possible feedback to policy measures generated by the project that will contribute to
designing, monitoring, reviewing  and rectifying (if necessary) existing policy and programmatic
measures or shaping and supporting the implementation of new policy initiatives and decisions.

o a list of deliverables (table 3.1c);
 Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in
which it is to be carried out.  . Each work package should be a substantial part of the work
plan, and the  number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and
complexity of the project.

2 Whether the proposal can be submitted by a single applicant depends on what is specified in the Work Programme for the particular Challenge that this
proposal is submitted to.

EU Grants: Application form (HE EIC Pathfinder Challenges): V3.4 – 12.06.2024


Part B - Page 13 of 21
 Structure each work package by breaking it down into tasks. If tasks are not appropriate,
work packages can be organised according to other criteria (e.g., according to the type o f
work or thematically). For each task or element of the work package, describe all activities
to be carried out and quantify them (e.g., number of protocols, tests, measurements,
combinations, study subjects, conferences, publications, etc.).  Provide enough detail to
clarify who will do this work and why it is needed for the project , (e.g., the level of
qualification and number of person- months for personnel, as well as the requested
equipment, consumables, meetings, etc.) to justify the proposed resources  and so that
progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.
 Resources (person -months) assigned to work packages should be in line with their
objectives and deliverables. You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘ project
management’, and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘data management’
‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks
or distinct work packages.
 You will be required to update the ‘plan for the dissemination and exploi tation of results
including communication activities ’, and a ‘data management plan’,  (this does not apply
to topics where a plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related
to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken and those still planned.
 Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget
table in section 3 of the application forms, and the number of person months, shown in
the detailed work package descriptions.
• a list of milestones (table 3.1d).
• a list of  critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project's objectives may not be
achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. You will be able to update the list of critical risks and
mitigation measures as the project progresses (table 3.1e).
• a table showing number of person months required (table 3.1f)
• a table showing description and justification of subcontracting costs for each participant (table 3.1g)
• a table showing justif ications for ‘purchase costs ’ (table 3.1h ) for participants where those  costs exceed
15% of the personnel costs (according to the budget table in proposal part A)
• if applicable, a table showing justifications for ‘other costs categories’ (table 3.1i)
• if applicable, a table showing in-kind contributions from third parties (table 3.1j)

3.2  Quality of the applicant/consortium
#@CON-SOR-CS@# #@PRJ-MGT-PM@#
 The individual participants of the consortium are described in a separate section under Part A. There is no
need to repeat that information here.

expertise in social sciences and humanities, open science practices, and gender aspects of R&I.  Include in
the description affiliated entities and associated partners, if any.

• Demonstrate that the partners will have access to critical  infrastructure needed to carry out the project’s
activities (or of the single applicant in case of mono-beneficiary application).
• In what way does each of the partners contribute to the project? Sh ow that each has a valid role, and
adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role.

• If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the
results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are
proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2).
• Other countries and international organisations : If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding
is based in a country or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible for such funding
(entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the
exhaustive list included in Annex 3 of the EIC Work Programme are autom atically eligible for EU funding),
explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to successfully carry out the project.

ANNEXES TO PROPOSAL PART B
Some calls may ask to upload annexes to proposal part B. The annexes must be uploaded as separate documents
in the submission system. The most common annexes to be uploaded in Horizon Europe are (standard templates
are published in the Funding & Tenders portal):


• DETAILED BUDGET TABLE: Annex with information for estimation of lump sum funding.
• CLINICAL TRIALS: Annex with information on clinical trials
• FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THIRD PARTIES: Annex with information on financial support to third parties.
• CALLS FLAGGED AS SECURITY SENSITIVE: Annex with information on security aspects.
• ETHICS: ethics self -assessment should be included in proposal part A. However, in calls where several
serious ethics issues are expected, the character limited in this sectio n of proposal part A may not be
sufficient for participants to give all necessary information. In those cases, participants may include
additional information in an annex to proposal part B.
