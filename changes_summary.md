# Summary of Changes to Grant Proposal

This document outlines the revisions made to the CausalPCa grant proposal (`main_horizon.tex`) in response to the reviewer's feedback. The changes are designed to strengthen the proposal's clarity, accountability, and compliance with the EIC Pathfinder Challenge guidelines.

## 1. Leadership Structure and Principal Investigator (PI)

*   **Action:** The proposal was revised to designate a single Principal Investigator (PI) with a dual specialization in radiology and nuclear medicine. The second leader, with a specialization in nuclear medicine and an IT background, was re-designated as a co-coordinator.
*   **Rationale:** This addresses the reviewer's critical feedback regarding the ambiguity of a "shared PI" role. The new structure provides clear leadership and accountability, as expected by the EIC.

## 2. Budget Integration and Justification

*   **Action:** All budget details, including personnel, equipment, travel, and other costs, were moved from the separate `budget.tex` file into a new "Resources and Budget Justification" section within `main_horizon.tex`.
*   **Rationale:** This follows the reviewer's instruction that all essential information, including budget justifications, must be included within the main proposal (Part B), as there is no separate narrative budget section.

## 3. Strengthened Budget Rationale

*   **Action:** A new introductory paragraph was added to the budget section to explicitly justify the total requested amount.
*   **Rationale:** This addresses the reviewer's concern that the budget might be perceived as too low. The new text explains that the budget is realistic and sufficient due to the leveraging of existing institutional resources and a lean, efficient project design.

## 4. Detailed Cost Justifications

*   **Action:** Detailed justifications for all cost categories have been integrated into the main proposal.
    *   **Personnel Costs:** Roles are now defined with corresponding experience levels (e.g., Senior Researcher, Postdoctoral Researcher) based on the German academic system (TV-L).
    *   **Equipment Costs:** The justification for the NVIDIA DGX B200 system has been included, and the text has been updated to clarify that depreciation costs will be budgeted.
    *   **Other Costs:** Justifications for software licenses, consultations, and other expenses are now clearly stated.
*   **Rationale:** This provides the necessary detail for evaluators to assess the appropriateness of the requested resources, as recommended by the reviewer.

## 5. Specific Reviewer Comments Addressed

*   **Named Institutions:** The placeholder names for collaborating institutions have been replaced with their actual names (Department of Nuclear Medicine at University Hospital Halle, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Radiological Practice Sudenburg).
*   **Indirect Cost Rate:** The indirect cost rate was updated from 20% to 25% to align with EIC Lump Sum rules.
*   **Personnel Definitions:** The personnel roles have been defined in the context of the German academic system (TV-L) to provide clarity.

These changes collectively address all the points raised by the reviewer, resulting in a more robust, transparent, and compelling grant proposal.
