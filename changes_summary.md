# Summary of Changes to Grant Proposal

This document outlines the revisions made to the CausalPCa grant proposal (`main_horizon.tex`).

## Task 1: Address Reviewer Feedback

*   **Leadership Structure:** The proposal was revised to designate a single Principal Investigator (PI) and a co-coordinator to ensure clear leadership and accountability.
*   **Budget Integration:** All budget details and justifications were moved from `budget.tex` into `main_horizon.tex`.
*   **Budget Rationale:** A comprehensive rationale for the total budget was added to justify the requested amount.
*   **Cost Details:** Detailed justifications for all costs were provided, including personnel roles, equipment depreciation, and other direct costs. The indirect cost rate was corrected to 25%.
*   **Named Institutions:** Placeholder names for collaborating institutions were replaced with their actual names.

## Task 2: Reduce Page Count

*   **Goal:** To reduce the length of the proposal to a maximum of 30 pages while preserving the core technical content.
*   **Actions:**
    *   The text in non-essential sections (Abstract, Vision, Impact, and parts of the Implementation section) was condensed.
    *   The page margins were adjusted to the minimum allowed by the guidelines (15mm).
    *   The `Illustrative Clinical Workflow` figure and its description were removed to save space.
*   **Result:** The final document is 28 pages long, successfully meeting the page limit requirement.

These changes collectively address all the points raised by the reviewer and the user, resulting in a more robust, transparent, and concise grant proposal.
