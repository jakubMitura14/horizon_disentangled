## List of Unverified Citations

1.  **Claim:** "Widespread screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has led to the frequent detection of indolent, clinically insignificant cancers, resulting in overtreatment and significant morbidity."
    *   **Citation Keys:** `PadhaniSchoots2023`, `JenaTaneja2018`, `CaraccioloCastello2022`

2.  **Claim:** "Conversely, many PCa deaths are due to the late diagnosis of aggressive or metastatic disease."
    *   **Citation Key:** `PadhaniSchoots2023`

3.  **Claim:** "The stakes of misstaging are incredibly high; the distinction between localized and metastatic disease carries profound prognostic implications, with the 5-year survival rate dropping from nearly 100% to as low as 30â€“40%."
    *   **Citation Keys:** `WangODwyer2024`, `CereserEvangelista2023`

4.  **Claim:** "We will fine-tune a pre-trained TotalSegmentator model to provide anatomical ground truth."
    *   **Citation Key:** `Wasserthal_2023`

5.  **Claim:** "Our team has developed and validated models for predicting disease progression by fusing clinical and imaging data in Prostate cancer."
    *   **Citation Key:** `Wybranska_2025`

6.  **Claim:** "From this clinical data, we will experiment with and derive various features that have proven prognostic impact, such as PSA doubling time, tumor volume, and the number of bone metastases."
