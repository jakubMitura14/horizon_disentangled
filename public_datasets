Of course. Here is a detailed analysis of datasets containing longitudinal prostate cancer imaging studies, based on the research documents you provided.

### **Executive Summary**

Based on a thorough review of the provided research, several key resources exist for longitudinal prostate cancer research, though no single public dataset perfectly matches all desired criteria without some caveats.

  * **For Deep Multi-Modal & Radiogenomic Research:** **The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD)** is the most comprehensive option. It offers an implicitly longitudinal series of MRI, CT, and PET scans with preserved time intervals. Crucially, it links directly to the required clinical data (PSA, Gleason, TNM) and extensive genomic data. Access is free but requires a formal application for controlled data and involves significant computational overhead.

  * **For Focused Treatment Response Studies:** The **NAF-PROSTATE** dataset is the best choice for studying treatment response in bone metastases. It was explicitly designed as a longitudinal PET/CT study with systematic time points (baseline, 6, and 12 months) and is linked to serial PSA data. Access is direct and free.

  * **For Population-Level & Pre-Symptomatic Studies:** The **UK Biobank (UKB)** offers an unparalleled resource for population-level discovery. It has a massive cohort with longitudinal abdominal MRI scans and high-quality PSA (KLK3 protein) data. However, the MRIs are not clinical-grade prostate scans, and key clinical data (Gleason, TNM) must be extracted from linked cancer registry records. Access requires a tiered fee and use of a secure cloud platform, though significant discounts are available.

  * **For AI Development in Active Surveillance:** The **ProstateNET** platform (from the ProCAncer-I project, part of the EUCAIM ecosystem) offers a specific dataset (**UC8**) designed for active surveillance. This 297-case cohort contains the required longitudinal MRI, biopsy, and PSA data. Access is via a gated portal requiring researcher authentication.

Datasets like PI-CAI and PLCO, while valuable in their own right, are unsuitable for this specific query as they are designed for single-timepoint diagnostic AI development or lack in-vivo radiological imaging entirely.

### **Detailed Analysis of Prostate Cancer Imaging Datasets**

Here is a breakdown of the primary data sources identified in your documents, evaluated against your specific requirements.

#### **1. The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD)**

  * **Overview:** A landmark project from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that provides a multi-dimensional map of genomic changes in prostate cancer. It is the premier resource for linking imaging phenotypes with deep clinical, pathological, and molecular data.
  * **Longitudinal Imaging Availability:**
      * **Nature:** Implicitly longitudinal. While not a systematic time-series study, a subset of patients received multiple scans for clinical reasons prior to surgery. The temporal relationship (days between scans) is accurately preserved, enabling valid longitudinal analysis.
      * **Modalities:** MRI, CT, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are available for a subset of the cohort.
      * **Caveat:** The data is highly heterogeneous, as it was collected from multiple institutions using routine clinical protocols, not a standardized research protocol. This requires significant data harmonization work.
  * **Clinical Data Linkage:**
      * **PSA:** Yes. Both baseline "Pre-op PSA Level" and longitudinal outcomes based on "consecutively elevated PSA results" are available.
      * **Gleason Score:** Yes. Primary, Secondary, and Total Gleason Scores are recorded from the tumor specimen.
      * **TNM Staging:** Yes. Full pathologic TNM staging information is available.
  * **Access and Cost Analysis:**
      * **Mechanism:** A multi-step process. Open-access data (including DICOM images) can be downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and the Genomic Data Commons (GDC). Access to controlled, granular clinical and genomic data requires a formal application through the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).
      * **Cost:** There is **no direct financial cost** to access the data. The primary costs are indirect, involving researcher time for the application process and the significant computational expense for downloading, storing, and analyzing the petabyte-scale dataset.
  * **Strategic Recommendation:** **Highly Recommended.** This is the best-fit dataset for researchers aiming to conduct integrative, multi-modal studies connecting longitudinal radiological changes with underlying genomic drivers of disease.

#### **2. UK Biobank (UKB)**

  * **Overview:** A massive, prospective, population-based study of approximately 500,000 participants in the United Kingdom. It is unparalleled in scale for investigating the earliest markers of disease.
  * **Longitudinal Imaging Availability:**
      * **Nature:** Explicitly longitudinal. The "Repeat Imaging Project" is re-scanning up to 60,000 participants 2-7 years after their initial scan, creating a powerful "before and after" dataset.
      * **Modalities:** Abdominal MRI. The prostate gland is included in the field of view.
      * **Caveat:** Critically, this is **not** a dedicated, clinical multi-parametric prostate MRI (mpMRI). It is a general-purpose abdominal scan lacking the specific sequences (like high b-value DWI) used for clinical diagnosis. CT and PET-PSMA scans are definitively **not available**.
  * **Clinical Data Linkage:**
      * **PSA:** Yes. Available in two forms: self-reported history of PSA tests and, more importantly, high-quality quantitative proteomic measurement of the KLK3 protein (the basis of clinical PSA tests), which has shown superior predictive power.
      * **Gleason Score:** Indirectly available. This data is not a direct field but is contained within linked National Cancer Registry records. It requires significant bioinformatic work to extract and harmonize.
      * **TNM Staging:** Indirectly available. Same as the Gleason score, this information must be parsed from raw, linked cancer registry records.
  * **Access and Cost Analysis:**
      * **Mechanism:** Access is granted via a formal application to a tiered system. All analysis is performed within a secure cloud environment, the Research Analysis Platform (RAP).
      * **Cost:** A Tier 3 application (required for imaging) has a standard fee of **£9,000 + VAT** for a three-year license. However, this is significantly reduced to **£500 + VAT for students** (PhD, MSc, etc.). Researchers from eligible Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) may have the fee waived entirely. Ongoing costs for computation and storage on the RAP are incurred, but substantial credits (£1,000+) are available through various programs to offset these charges.
  * **Strategic Recommendation:** Recommended for large-scale epidemiological studies, identifying pre-symptomatic biomarkers, or investigating incidental findings. It is not suitable for research that requires clinical-grade diagnostic imaging.

#### **3. NAF-PROSTATE**

  * **Overview:** A dedicated longitudinal cohort hosted on TCIA, specifically designed to monitor treatment response in prostate cancer patients with osseous (bone) metastases using 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT imaging.
  * **Longitudinal Imaging Availability:**
      * **Nature:** Explicitly longitudinal and systematic. Scans were acquired at baseline, 6 months (+/- 2), and 12 months (+/- 2) following therapy.
      * **Modalities:** PET/CT (using the 18F-NaF bone-seeking tracer).
      * **Caveat:** This dataset is highly specialized for bone metastases and does not include MRI or PSMA-PET scans of the prostate itself.
  * **Clinical Data Linkage:**
      * **PSA:** Yes. While not listed in the TCIA metadata, the primary publications from this cohort confirm that imaging changes were correlated with "prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change," meaning serial PSA data is available.
      * **Gleason Score:** Probable. This would have been recorded as part of the standard-of-care workup for patients with advanced disease.
      * **TNM Staging:** Probable. As with the Gleason score, this is standard clinical information for this patient population.
  * **Access and Cost Analysis:**
      * **Mechanism:** Simple and direct. The data can be downloaded directly from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) public portal.
      * **Cost:** **Free.** Users must adhere to the TCIA Data Usage Policy and cite the dataset in any publications.
  * **Strategic Recommendation:** **Highly Recommended** for a focused research project on quantitatively assessing treatment response in prostate cancer bone metastases using PET/CT.

#### **4. Cancer Image Europe (EUCAIM) / ProCAncer-I / ProstateNET**

  * **Overview:** EUCAIM is a pan-European federated infrastructure connecting cancer image repositories. Its primary prostate cancer data comes from the ProCAncer-I project, which is made available through the **ProstateNET** platform.
  * **Longitudinal Imaging Availability:**
      * **Nature:** The ProstateNET archive contains a specific dataset, **UC8: Dataset for Prostate Cancer Patient Stratification in Active Surveillance**, which is explicitly longitudinal.
      * **Modalities:** This dataset contains MRI scans.
      * **Caveat:** While the overall EUCAIM infrastructure is vast, finding a specific multi-modal (MRI/CT/PET) longitudinal dataset requires navigating its constituent projects. The central EUCAIM public catalogue was noted to be inaccessible at the time of the report, making ProstateNET the most direct entry point.
  * **Clinical Data Linkage (for UC8 Active Surveillance dataset):**
      * **PSA:** Yes. Longitudinal PSA data is included.
      * **Gleason Score:** Yes. Biopsy data is included, which would contain Gleason/ISUP grading.
      * **TNM Staging:** Likely available as part of the initial diagnostic workup for these patients.
  * **Access and Cost Analysis:**
      * **Mechanism:** A "gated" public access model. Researchers must register for an account via the Life Science AAI (Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure) and submit a formal request to access the dataset(s) through the ProstateNET portal.
      * **Cost:** Access is **free for the research community**, but the administrative overhead and lead time for approval must be factored into project planning.
  * **Strategic Recommendation:** Recommended for researchers specifically focused on AI development for active surveillance, as the UC8 dataset is tailored for this exact purpose.
