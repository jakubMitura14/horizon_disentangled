\section*{Budget Justification and Allocation}

The total requested budget for the CausalPCa project is \textbf{\EUR{3,551,486}} over a period of 36 months. This budget is designed to provide the necessary resources to achieve the ambitious objectives outlined in this proposal. The costs are broken down by Work Package (WP) and cost category, with detailed justifications provided below. All costs are estimated in EUR.

\subsection*{A. Direct Costs}

\subsubsection*{A.1 Personnel Costs}
Personnel costs represent the largest portion of the budget, reflecting the highly skilled, interdisciplinary team required to tackle the complex, multi-faceted nature of this project. The successful integration of advanced imaging, clinical data, histopathology, and multi-omics data requires a diverse team with expertise spanning nuclear medicine, radiology, data science, mathematics, and software engineering. Costs are calculated for a 36-month project duration based on the provided institutional salary tables (TV-L), including all social security contributions. A total of \textbf{288 person-months (PMs)} are budgeted.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - PI (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} \EUR{263,141}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - Post-Doc (2 FTEs, 72 PMs):} \EUR{526,282}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - PhD Student (3 FTEs, 108 PMs):} \EUR{789,423}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - Mathematician (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} \EUR{131,570}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - Data Scientist (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} \EUR{263,141}
    \item \textbf{Technical Staff (Technischer Angestellter) - Programmer (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} \EUR{202,983}
    \item \textbf{Technical Staff (Technischer Angestellter) - Project Manager (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} \EUR{101,492}
    \item \textbf{Student/Research Assistant (Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft) (40hrs/month, 36 months):} \EUR{33,040}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Personnel Costs: \EUR{2,311,072}}

\subsubsection*{A.2 Equipment Costs}
This category covers costs for HPC resources and long-term data storage.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPU Cluster / Cloud Computing Credits:} We request a budget for dedicated access to a GPU cluster or equivalent cloud computing credits (e.g., AWS, GCP). This is critical for training the large-scale generative models proposed in WP3 and WP4.
    \item \textbf{XNAT Server Storage (200 TB):} A budget is allocated for secure, long-term storage of the curated multi-center dataset on a dedicated XNAT server. This ensures data integrity, availability, and compliance with data protection regulations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Equipment Costs: \EUR{504,000}}

\subsubsection*{A.3 Travel Costs}
The travel budget is allocated for project meetings and dissemination of project results at leading international conferences.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Meetings (3):} Budget for travel and accommodation for the project team and key external collaborators to attend a kick-off meeting (M1 in Magdeburg), a mid-term review meeting (M18), and a final project meeting (M36 in Magdeburg).
    \item \textbf{International Conferences (6):} Budget to allow key personnel (PI, Postdocs, PhDs) to present project findings at major international conferences such as RSNA, ECR, MICCAI, and NeurIPS. This is crucial for WP6 (Dissemination).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Travel Costs: \EUR{32,500}}

\subsubsection*{A.4 Other Direct Costs}
This category includes costs for publications, dataset access, and other minor expenses.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Access Publication Fees:} To comply with Horizon Europe's open science mandate, we have budgeted for Article Processing Charges (APCs) for an estimated 10 high-impact journal publications.
    \item \textbf{UK Biobank Access:} A fee of \EUR{12,000} is budgeted for access to the UK Biobank dataset.
    \item \textbf{Software Licenses:} A provision of \EUR{36,000} is budgeted for specialized software licenses.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Consultations:} A budget of \EUR{54,000} is allocated for small monthly consultations with external experts in urology, histopathology, and radiology.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Other Direct Costs: \EUR{112,000}}

\subsection*{B. Indirect Costs (Overheads)}
Indirect costs are calculated as a flat rate of \textbf{20\% of the total direct costs}, in accordance with Horizon Europe rules. These costs cover general institutional overheads.

\textbf{Total Direct Costs (A): \EUR{2,959,572}}

\textbf{Indirect Costs (B = 20\% of A): \EUR{591,914}}

\subsection*{C. Total Project Budget}
The total requested funding is the sum of total direct and indirect costs.

\textbf{Total Estimated Project Cost (A + B):} \EUR{3,551,486}
