\section*{Budget Justification and Allocation}

The total requested budget for the CausalPCa project is \textbf{\EUR{3,287,969}} over a period of 36 months. This budget is designed to provide the necessary resources to achieve the ambitious objectives outlined in this proposal. The costs are broken down by Work Package (WP) and cost category, with detailed justifications provided below. All costs are estimated in EUR.

\subsection*{A. Direct Costs}

\subsubsection*{A.1 Personnel Costs}
Personnel costs represent the largest portion of the budget, reflecting the highly skilled, interdisciplinary team required for this project. Costs are estimated based on standard institutional rates for the Magdeburg area, including social security contributions. A total of \textbf{333 person-months (PMs)} are budgeted. Note on terminology: effort is measured in Person-Months (PMs), where one PM is the work of one person for one month. This is sometimes referred to as a Man-Person (MP). A Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) represents one person working full-time for one year.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Principal Investigator (PI) / Senior Researcher (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} The PI will dedicate 100\% of their time to the project, providing scientific leadership, coordinating all WPs, and leading dissemination activities (WP6, WP7).
    \item \textbf{Senior Clinical Scientist (0.25 FTE, 9 PMs):} A senior researcher with dual expertise in nuclear medicine and radiology will dedicate 25\% of their time to coordinate the imaging pipeline, provide a holistic view on the data, and ensure clinical relevance (WP1, WP5).
    \item \textbf{Postdoctoral Researchers (2 FTEs, 72 PMs):} Two postdoctoral researchers will form the core of the technical development team, leading tasks in WP2 (Supervisor Models), WP3 (Causal VAE), and WP4 (Temporal Modeling).
    \item \textbf{PhD Students (3 FTEs, 108 PMs):} Three PhD students will support all technical WPs, focusing on model implementation, data curation, and experimental validation. Their work will form the basis of their doctoral theses.
    \item \textbf{Programmer (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} A programmer will be responsible for software development, code optimization, and maintenance of the project's computational infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Project Manager (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} A part-time project manager will handle administrative, financial, and reporting duties, ensuring the project runs smoothly and meets all EC requirements (WP7).
    \item \textbf{Data Scientist/Engineer (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} A dedicated data engineer will manage the complex data curation, harmonization, and storage pipeline in WP1 and support the data requirements of subsequent WPs.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Research Assistant (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} A part-time research assistant will support the clinical validation and workflow integration studies in WP5.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Personnel Costs: \EUR{2,011,875}}

\subsubsection*{A.2 Equipment Costs}
This category covers costs for HPC resources and long-term data storage.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPU Cluster / Cloud Computing Credits:} We request a budget for dedicated access to a GPU cluster or equivalent cloud computing credits (e.g., AWS, GCP). This is critical for training the large-scale generative models proposed in WP3 and WP4.
    \item \textbf{XNAT Server Storage (200 TB):} A budget is allocated for secure, long-term storage of the curated multi-center dataset on a dedicated XNAT server. This ensures data integrity, availability, and compliance with data protection regulations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Equipment Costs: \EUR{504,000}}

\subsubsection*{A.3 Travel Costs}
The travel budget is allocated for project meetings and dissemination of project results at leading international conferences.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Meetings (3):} Budget for travel and accommodation for the project team and key external collaborators to attend a kick-off meeting (M1 in Magdeburg), a mid-term review meeting (M18), and a final project meeting (M36 in Magdeburg).
    \item \textbf{International Conferences (6):} Budget to allow key personnel (PI, Postdocs, PhDs) to present project findings at major international conferences such as RSNA, ECR, MICCAI, and NeurIPS. This is crucial for WP6 (Dissemination).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Travel Costs: \EUR{32,500}}

\subsubsection*{A.4 Other Direct Costs}
This category includes costs for publications, dataset access, and other minor expenses.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Access Publication Fees:} To comply with Horizon Europe's open science mandate, we have budgeted for Article Processing Charges (APCs) for an estimated 10 high-impact journal publications.
    \item \textbf{UK Biobank Access:} A fee of \EUR{12,000} (based on an estimated \pounds9,000 plus \pounds1,000 for administration) is budgeted for access to the UK Biobank dataset, a key resource for validating our models on a large population cohort.
    \item \textbf{Software Licenses:} A provision of \EUR{1,000} per month (\EUR{36,000} total) is budgeted for specialized software licenses, including advanced AI development tools, statistical software, and collaboration platforms to enhance research productivity and effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Other Direct Costs: \EUR{82,000}}

\subsection*{B. Indirect Costs (Overheads)}
Indirect costs are calculated as a flat rate of \textbf{25\% of the total direct costs}, in accordance with Horizon Europe rules. These costs cover general institutional overheads such as administration, utilities, and office space that support the research activities.

\textbf{Total Direct Costs (A): \EUR{2,630,375}} \\
\textbf{Indirect Costs (B = 25\% of A): \EUR{657,594}}

\subsection*{C. Total Project Budget}
The total requested funding is the sum of total direct and indirect costs.

\textbf{Total Estimated Project Cost (A + B): \EUR{3,287,969}}
