\paragraph{1. Strategic Imperative: An NVIDIA DGX B200 as the Project's Cornerstone}
To pursue the project's visionary goal of creating a causal AI framework for medicine, an investment in computational power that is commensurate with the scale of the scientific challenge is required. The budget is therefore centered on the acquisition of an \textbf{NVIDIA DGX B200 system}. This is not a conventional server but a purpose-built, integrated AI supercomputer that directly addresses the primary technical risks of the project.

\paragraph{2. Justification for the DGX B200 Solution}
The choice of the DGX B200 is driven by key technical requirements of the proposed research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solving the VRAM Bottleneck:} The project's focus on high-resolution 3D medical imaging is severely limited by GPU memory (VRAM). The DGX B200 provides a massive \textbf{1.44 TB of unified, high-bandwidth GPU memory}, which is essential for training the large, complex 3D VAE and Diffusion Models at the heart of our methodology. This capability is critical to de-risk the core of the project.
    \item \textbf{Powering Complex, Multi-Stage Workflows:} Our four-stage causal framework requires intensive, iterative re-training cycles. The DGX B200's architecture, with eight tightly interconnected GPUs, is engineered for exactly this kind of complex, distributed workload, ensuring maximum efficiency for model development.
    \item \textbf{Turnkey Solution to Reduce Engineering Overhead:} As a fully integrated and validated platform, the DGX B200 allows the research team to focus immediately on scientific discovery rather than spending months on system integration and debugging. It includes the necessary NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and support, accelerating the timeline from deployment to discovery.
    \item \textbf{High-Throughput Data Processing:} The system's architecture, including features like GPUDirect Storage, is optimized to handle the large-scale (~200-400 TB) multimodal datasets of this project, ensuring the powerful GPUs are never left "starved" for data.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{3. Storage and Integration}
To complement the DGX B200, the budget includes a \textbf{300 TB enterprise storage solution} and the mandatory \textbf{professional installation and integration services}. This ensures the entire system is deployed correctly, validated, and ready to support the project's ambitious research agenda from day one. This on-premise solution provides a cost-effective and secure way to manage the project's large data assets without the variable ongoing costs of cloud storage. Should market conditions allow for the procurement of this hardware at a lower cost than budgeted, any remaining funds will be re-allocated to secure cloud solutions to further enhance the project's computational flexibility.
