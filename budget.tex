\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Personnel Costs: \EUR{2,190,757}}

\subsubsection*{Personnel Justification}
The personnel budget is structured to support the project's ambitious goals through a dedicated, interdisciplinary team. The justification for each role is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - PI (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} The PI will provide the overall scientific vision and leadership, ensuring the project stays on track and meets its objectives. They will coordinate the complex, interdisciplinary work across all WPs and lead the high-level scientific dissemination and exploitation activities (WP6, WP7).
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - PhD Student (3 FTEs, 108 PMs):} Three PhD students are critical for the project's execution. Their roles are multifaceted, involving the crucial tasks of data curation, cleaning, and annotation across all data modalities, including imaging, histopathology, and omics data. They will also be instrumental in implementing and training the AI models and conducting the rigorous experimental validation needed to ensure their robustness and accuracy. Their work will directly support the clinical teams in urology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and histopathology and will form the foundation of their doctoral theses.
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - Mathematician (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} A half-time mathematician is required to provide the essential theoretical support for the novel causal models being developed. This role will focus on ensuring the mathematical soundness of the framework, particularly the complex Neural Jump ODEs (WP4), and will contribute to the development of robust uncertainty quantification methods.
    \item \textbf{Scientific Staff (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) - Data Scientist (1 FTE, 36 PMs):} A dedicated data scientist is vital for managing the project's complex and heterogeneous data. This role will oversee the entire data pipeline, from curation and harmonization (WP1) to secure storage and access, ensuring the integrity and usability of the data for all technical work packages.
    \item \textbf{Technical Staff (Technischer Angestellter) - Programmer (3 FTEs, 108 PMs):} Three full-time programmers are required to build the robust, scalable, and production-ready software that forms the backbone of this project. They will be responsible for the end-to-end software engineering, including developing the data processing pipelines, implementing the AI models with a focus on efficiency and optimization, and creating the user-facing clinical validation tools. The number of programmers is justified by the need for parallel development on the different components of the multi-stage framework.
    \item \textbf{Technical Staff (Technischer Angestellter) - Project Manager (0.5 FTE, 18 PMs):} A part-time project manager is essential for the operational success of this multi-partner project. This role extends beyond standard administrative duties to include coordinating data sharing and harmonization between the collaborating clinics, managing the grant documentation and reporting to the EC, and actively tracking development logs to ensure all project activities are compatible with the principles and requirements of the EU AI Act (WP7).
    \item \textbf{Student/Research Assistant (Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft) (40hrs/month, 36 months):} A part-time research assistant will provide essential support for the data collection efforts and the clinical validation studies in WP5, assisting with patient data management and study logistics.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Consultations:} A dedicated budget for small monthly consultations with external experts in urology, histopathology, and radiology is included to ensure that the project's development remains clinically relevant and grounded in real-world practice.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{A.2 Equipment Costs}
This category covers costs for HPC resources and long-term data storage.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPU Cluster / Cloud Computing Credits:} We request a budget for dedicated access to a GPU cluster or equivalent cloud computing credits (e.g., AWS, GCP). This is critical for training the large-scale generative models proposed in WP3 and WP4.
    \item \textbf{XNAT Server Storage (200 TB):} A budget is allocated for secure, long-term storage of the curated multi-center dataset on a dedicated XNAT server. This ensures data integrity, availability, and compliance with data protection regulations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Equipment Costs: \EUR{504,000}}

\subsubsection*{A.3 Travel Costs}
The travel budget is allocated for project meetings and dissemination of project results at leading international conferences.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Meetings (3):} Budget for travel and accommodation for the project team and key external collaborators to attend a kick-off meeting (M1 in Magdeburg), a mid-term review meeting (M18), and a final project meeting (M36 in Magdeburg).
    \item \textbf{International Conferences (6):} Budget to allow key personnel (PI, PhDs, Programmers) to present project findings at major international conferences such as RSNA, ECR, MICCAI, and NeurIPS. This is crucial for WP6 (Dissemination).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Travel Costs: \EUR{32,500}}

\subsubsection*{A.4 Other Direct Costs}
This category includes costs for publications, dataset access, and other minor expenses.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Access Publication Fees:} To comply with Horizon Europe's open science mandate, we have budgeted for Article Processing Charges (APCs) for an estimated 10 high-impact journal publications.
    \item \textbf{UK Biobank Access:} A fee of \EUR{12,000} is budgeted for access to the UK Biobank dataset.
    \item \textbf{Software Licenses:} A provision of \EUR{36,000} is budgeted for specialized software licenses.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Consultations:} A budget of \EUR{54,000} is allocated for small monthly consultations with external experts in urology, histopathology, and radiology.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Estimated Other Direct Costs: \EUR{112,000}}

\subsection*{B. Indirect Costs (Overheads)}
Indirect costs are calculated as a flat rate of \textbf{20\% of the total direct costs}, in accordance with Horizon Europe rules. These costs cover general institutional overheads.

\textbf{Total Direct Costs (A): \EUR{2,839,257}}

\textbf{Indirect Costs (B = 20\% of A): \EUR{567,851}}

\subsection*{C. Total Project Budget}
The total requested funding is the sum of total direct and indirect costs.

\textbf{Total Estimated Project Cost (A + B):} \EUR{3,407,108}
