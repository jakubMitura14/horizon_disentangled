Nonetheless, this does not preclude you to request larger amounts, if duly justified or stated otherwise in the specific Challenge. \rThe funding rate of this grant will be 100% of the eligible costs. Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum and the amount will be determined during the evaluation process. Applicants must therefore propose the amount of the lump sum based on their estimated project costs...\"\r\r"

        "content": "Caution:\r\rIf an EIC Pathfinder Challenge proposal requests a significantly lower budget (in this case 80 % of the indicative 4 million), it can signal both positive and negative aspects:\r\rPositive:\r1. Efficiency and Focus: \r- It may indicate that a lean, efficient project, with well-scoped objectives and realistic resource allocation has been designed.\r- If budget is clearly justified and proportional to proposed work, it can signal credibility and cost-awareness\r2. Strong complementary Funding & Resources\r- it can be seen as a strategic and responsible use of EU Funding (if for example, activities & infrastructure are already covered by other sources (complementary programs, institutional funds, etc).\r3. Targeted, High-Impact Research\r- A slightly smaller but highly focused approach could be perceived as more manageable and thus, with higher likelihood of success\r\rNegative\r\r1. Underestimation of Workload or Ambition\r- Targeted budget ceiling (EUR 4 Million) reflects the expected scale and ambition of projects\r- Asking for much less may suggest a narrower project scope, or insufficiently ambitious to meet all projected call goals\r2. Incomplete or Unrealistic Planning\r- Lower budget might raise concerns that the applicant understimates costs (particularly in high risk research where costs can be substantial)\r- Evaluators might worry that the applicant won\u00b4t be able to deliver the full set of expected outcomes\r3. Weaker \"consortium\" (As mentioned in our meeting)\r- If the budget is too low because key expertise is missing, this could signal insufficient critical mass to achieve the results.\r\rTo sum up:\r\rIf a budget lower than the indicative Eur 4 million is requested, it is essential to clearly justify this choice within the proposal. Explain how existing resources, complementary funding (if this is the case) or institutional support reduce the overall financial need, while ensuring that the ambition and impact of the project remains fully aligned with the Pathfinder Challenge objectives and expected outcomes. Demonstrate that your cost structure is well reasoned and strategically designed, rather than simply reduced for appearance. \r\rTherefore, a balance between cautious, efficient budget planning and ambitious project design must be sough, reflecting financial realism and transformative scope as expected within this program"

        "content": "As noted in the Proposal document. \"The PI role will be shared by two individuals, each dedicating 50 % of their time to the project\" is not advisable and could weaken the proposal\u00b4s creditiliby.\r\rThis is problematic on the following grounds:\r1. EIC expects clear scientific and managerial leadership.\r- The proposal must have a single, identifiable PI. Sharing this role suggests divided responsibility, which might be interpreted as a lack of clear leadership or vision.\r2. Postdocs as PIs are possible, but woulr require strong justification.\r- The program does not explicitly require professors, but it does expect the PI to be a scientifically independent leader capable of driving the high-risk, high-gain research. Two postdocs sharing the PI role could raise doubts about seniority, independence and continuity.\r3. Single applicant = single accountability\r- The entire project (without a consortium) rests on one legal entity. Clear governance structure is expected and here \"shared PI\" creates ambiguity in accountability. \r4. 50 % time dedication may appear too low. \rEven for a full time PI, 50 % dedication may signal limited commitment to the project. \r\rAlternatives:\r- Designate one official PI (scientific lead named in the proposal)\r- Define the second as Co-Pi, Senior Scientist or Work Package leader, with substantial involvement and co-leadership of technical aspects.\r- Clearly show their complementary expertise and teamwork in the implementation section."

The portion of use of the device must be correspondingly verifiable (for example, by laboratory books) and auditable. Costs for the commissioning of the device, such as installation costs, can be added to the purchase price. The fact that the device purchase is project-related must be proven (for example, in the purchase contract).\"\r\rSource: https://www.horizont-europa.de/de/Abschreibungskosten-fur-Investitionen-und-Gerate-1962.html \r\rThus, the depreciation period should follow the organisation\u00b4s usual internal accounting practices and comply with national accounting rules. \r\rRegarding this, according to national regulations on \" Service life of computer hardware and data entry software and processing\" (Source: https://usth.bundesfinanzministerium.de/esth/2022/C-Anhaenge/Anhang-01/V/anhang-1-V.html)  a normal useful life of only year is to be applied instead of previous 3 to 5 years. (We would only need to confirm this internally). This could theoretically allow to depreciate the full cost of the equipment over the project duration. I will ask for the financial affairs department feedback here.\r"
